Briefly say that environmental risk are interesting to study because one might prevent said environment to prevent the disorder. 
\subsection{Maternal Immune activation}
Then we would like to talk about previous maternal immune activation studies. 
Their focus and findings. 
For example, the \gene{Il-6} gene studies, Oskvig, Smith, Placental, etc. 
Doesn't have to be as concise as that in the paper. 
But should follow similar logic. Just more in depth
\subsubsection{Immediate effect of maternal immune activation to gene expression pattern in foetal brain}
Here we further discuss how we focus on the current study: The immediate effect of MIA and also the effect of MIA during early gestation. 
Can follow some of the logic from the paper

\subsection{RNA Sequencing}
Discuss the use of RNA Sequencing, comparing with micro-array. 
\subsubsection{Different dimension of the transcriptom}
Should discuss all possible dimention of the RNA Seq data. 
Didn't include miRNA as they are not captured.
Should also mention Alternative splicing, fusion genes and denovo assembly.
\paragraph{Differential Gene Expression}
\paragraph{Alternative Splicing}
\paragraph{Fusion Genes}
\paragraph{Denovo transcripts}
Then should mention the problem of the analysis of Alternative splicing, fusion genes and denovo assembly:
Require large amount of wet lab validation in order to make sense of the data.
Our study is only a pilot study, therefore focus only on the differential expression analysis.
