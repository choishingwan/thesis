	One of the aim of pharmacogenetics is to be able to predict the treatment response of individuals based on their genetic data.
	An important parameter to consider here will be the heritability of antipsychotic drug response for it provide an upper bound of how much of the variation in treatment response can be predicted by genetic data. 
	However, it was extremely difficult to obtain twins and family data on antipsychotic drug response, making it impossible for the estimation of the heritability.
	
	In this chapter, we aimed to estimate the heritability of antipsychotic response, using data from the antipsychotic \gls{GWAS} and Exome Sequencing study. 
	Moreover, we were interested in investigating which functional categories were more important in antipsychotic drug response. 
	Therefore, we will also perform the partitioning of heritability on a series of functional categories.
	
	\section{Introduction}
	Here we try to use Beatrice's data and estimate the heritability explained in drug response.
	Should also repeat the region-wise heritability
