	%\chapter*{Some considerations}
	%\begin{enumerate}
	%	\item PRSice requires the phenotype to aid its selection (More information= stronger)
	%	\item It seems like LDSC doesn't necessary perform badly in oligogenic situation.
	%	Rather, it is that when the trait is oligogenic, it is more likely for LDSC to behaviour in a strange way.
	%	\item For each condition: extreme phenotype, quantitative trait, case control, we can have a separated review. 
	%	Discuss on the benefits and challenges of each condition and the method we deal with them.
	%	So we can have two chapters (case control, quantitative trait) where extreme phenotype can be a big subsection within quantitative trait.
	%	\item For each chapter, there will be this introduction (review on the method), our methodology (Calculation, implementation and also simulation), result (the simulation result). 
	%	Then we can have the application (PGC, network)
	%\end{enumerate}
	%Things that I have to include
	%\begin{enumerate}
	%	\item Schizophrenia
	%	\begin{enumerate}
	%		\item Case Control (PGC) \\ LDSC has basically did everything related to partitioning and genetic correlation, so we should focus on the brain network instead
	%		\item Drug Response \\ No one has done it before, should have a brief section here. 
	%		Focus should be with the \emph{heritability} of response, not to identify the variants.
	%		However, we can try to partition the heritability of drug response too.\\
	%		Is it really related to genetics? 
	%		Or is it something related to environmental?
	%		e.g. Discouraging family members leads to not adhere to medicine
	%	\end{enumerate}
	%	\item Heritability Estimation \\ This part should be straightforward, just the algorithm and the simulation results

	% Disease background
	\section{Schizophrenia}
	\Glng{scz} is a detrimental psychiatric disorder, affecting around $0.3\sim0.7\%$ of the population\citep{AmericanPsychiatricAssociation2013}.
	It is characterized by positive symptoms including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech and grossly disorganized behavior, and negative symptoms such as the diminished emotional expression\citep{AmericanPsychiatricAssociation2013} with a typical age of onset at late adolescent or late 20s in male and late 20s or early 30s in female\citep{Schultz2007}.
	
	\Glng{scz} not only impose long lasting health, social and financial burden not only to the patients, but also to their families\citep{Knapp2004}. 
	Even more so, patients with \glng{scz} increased suicide rate \citep{Saha2007}, leading to a higher mortality.
	Based on the \gls{who} report, \glng{scz} is one of the top 20 leading cause of \gls{yld} in 2012, ranking 16 among all possible causes (\cref{tab:whoYLD}), demonstrating the extent of impact from \glng{scz} to patients.

	Due to the severity of \glng{scz}, it has drawn much attention from the research community aiming to delineate the disease mechanics and be able to identify the risk factors.
	Arguably, the most important first step to any \glng{scz} study is to have a robust and reliable disease diagnosis.
	
	\section{Diagnosis}
	% Describe early problems of diagnosis
	% Describe current method of diagnosis
	\Glng{scz} was first named ``Dementia Praecox'' by Dr. Emil Kraepelin and was later renamed as \glng{scz} by Dr. Eugen Bleuler\citep{Jablensky2010}.
	Early nosological entity for \glng{scz} such as that in \gls{dsm}-\rom{1} and \gls{dsm}-\rom{2} were vague and unreliable where the inter-rater agreement can be as low as 54$\%$.\citep{Tsuang2000,Harvey2012} 
	
	Later nosologies addressed these problem by introducing structural assessment and clear defined criteria. 
	With these improvements, the inter-rater agreement of \gls{dsm}-\rom{3} raised to $\sim 90\%$ \citep{Harvey2012}, suggesting the diagnosis were much more reliable.
	
	Currently \gls{dsm} is at its 5th edition\citep{AmericanPsychiatricAssociation2013}. 
	A patient will be diagnosed with \glng{scz}(F20.9) if they suffered from 2 or more of the following symptoms for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period: 
	\begin{enumerate*}[label=\arabic*\upshape)]
		\item delusion; \label{ls:delusion}
		\item hallucinations;\label{ls:hallucinations}
		\item disorganized speech;\label{ls:disorganizedSpeech}
		\item grossly disorganized or catatonic behaviour; and\label{ls:catatonicBehavior}
		\item negative symptoms such as diminished emotional expression,\label{ls:negativeSymptoms}
	\end{enumerate*}  where one of the symptom must be either (\ref{ls:delusion}, (\ref{ls:hallucinations} or (\ref{ls:disorganizedSpeech}.
	Signs of disturbance also need to persist for at least 6-month before the patient can be diagnosed with \glng{scz}.
	
	\section{Risk Factors of Schizophrenia}
	\sectionmark{Risk Factors}
	\subsection{Epidemiological Studies}
	% Talk about brown's study, the increased risk of schizophrenia in the influenza epidemic
	% Talk about some other risk factors such as drug use etc
	Considerable effort has been made trying ot identify possible risk factors of \glng{scz}. 
	It was first observed that there was an increased risk of \glng{scz} in individual who were fetuses during the 1957 influenza epidemic\citep{Mednick1958}. 
	Subsequently, other infectious agents such as HSV-2 and \textit{T.gondii} were also found to increase the risk of \glng{scz} if an individual's mother were infected during pregnancy.
	As different infectious agents all increase the risk of \glng{scz}, it leads to the hypothesis of maternal immune activation \citep{Brown2010}.
	It was hypothesized that instead of a particular infectious agents, it was the maternal immune response that disrupt the brain development in the offspring, thus leading to an elevated risk of \glng{scz}.
	
	By utilizing the rodent models, it was found when the pregnant rodent was injected with the viral mimic \gls{polyic} or the bacterial \gls{lps}, the offspring will display neuropathological features similar to those observed in \glng{scz}\citep{Meyer2009b}.
	It was further demonstrated that similar findings can be obtained through the injection of only the \gls{il6}, suggesting that it was not the infection, but the maternal immune response that might have disrupted the fetal brain development.
	
	% Then talk about the transient effect of MIA
	% And also some problem of these studies where the model only work as an proxy as we can never make a schizophrenic mice for sure.
	% Then briefly talk about other possible risk factors e.g. drug use, alcohol abuse etc.
	% Most should be alone the line of brain damage or environmental insult?
	
	
	\subsection{Familial Studies}
	% Another important arm of studies come from the segragation studies of schizophrneia
	% Try to observe the segragation of schzoiphrenia. 
	% Might be able to talk about some early observations on twin / adoption studies
	
	% Talk about the segregation rate of sczhiophrenia in families
	% Finally, ask the question, whether if schizophrenia is nature or nurture
	Considerable efforts has been made to identify the risk factors of \glng{scz}.
	
	It was first observed that \glng{scz} tends to aggregate in families where relatives of schizophrenic patients tends to have higher risk of developing \glng{scz}\citep{gottesman1991schizophrenia}. %Need to be longer
	The fundamental question to ask would be whether what is the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors to \glng{scz}?
	\textbf{Whether if the \emph{difference} in phenotype is accounted by genetics or environmental factors?}

	\section{Broad Sense Heritability}

	A key concept in quantitative genetics is \emph{heritability}, which was defined as \emph{proportion} of total variance of a trait in a population explained by variation of genetic factors in the population.
	One can partition observed phenotype into a combination of genetic and environmental components\citep{Falconer1996}
	$$
	\text{Phenotype(P)}=\text{Genotype(G)}+\text{Environment(E)}
	$$
	where the variance of the observed phenotype ($\sigma_P^2$) can be expressed as variance of genotype ($\sigma_G^2$) and variance of environment ($\sigma_E^2$)
	$$
		\sigma_P^2=\sigma_G^2+\sigma_E^2
	$$
	The broad sense heritability can then be defined as the ratio between the variance of the observed phenotype and the variance of the genetic effects
	$$
	H^2=\frac{\sigma_G^2}{\sigma_P^2}
	$$
	
	One key feature of heritability is that it is a \emph{ratio} of \emph{populational} measurement at a specific time point.
	As a result of that, the heritability estimation might differ from one population to another due to difference in \gls{maf} and one might obtain a different heritability estimate if the method or time-point of measurement of the trait differs because of different environmental factors coming into play.
	An classical example was the study of \gls{iq} where the heritability estimation increases with age\citep{Bouchard2013}.
	It was hypothesize that the shared environment has a larger effect on individuals when they were young, and that as they become more independent, the effect of shared environment diminishes, leading to a \emph{increased portion} of variance in \gls{iq} explained by the variance in genetic\citep{Bouchard2013}. 
	
	\section{Narrow sense Heritability}
	In reality, the problem of heritability was more complicated for there were different forms of genetic effects. 
	For example, one can partition the genetic variance into variance of additive genetic effects ($\sigma_A^2$), variance of dominant genetic effects ($\sigma_D^2$) and other epistatic genetic effects ($\sigma_I^2$) such that
	$$
		\sigma_G^2=\sigma_A^2+\sigma_D^2+\sigma_I^2
	$$
	where additive genetic variance was the variance explained by the average effects of all loci involved in the determination of the trait, whereas dominant genetic effects and epistatic genetic effectss were the interaction between alleles at the \emph{same} locus or \emph{different} loci respectively.
	
	As individuals only transmit one copy of each allele to their offspring, relatives other than full siblings and identical twins will only share a maximum of one copy of the allele from each other.
	Considering that dominance and non-additive genetic effects were concerning the interactive effect, which usually involve more than one copy of the alleles, these effects are unlikely to contribute to the resemblance between relatives \citep{Visscher2008}.
	On the other hand, the additive genetic effects is usually transmitted from parent to offspring, thus it is usually more useful to consider the narrow sense heritability($h^2$) which only consider the additive genetic effects:
	\begin{align}
	h^2&=\frac{\sigma_A^2}{\sigma_P^2} \notag\\
	h^2&=\frac{\sigma_A^2}{\sigma_G^2+\sigma_E^2}
	\label{eq:narrowHeritability}
	\end{align}
	
	% add in how to calculate the heritability in normal way here
	To obtain the additive genetic effect, we can first consider the genetic effect of parents to be $G_p=A+D$. 
	As only half of the additive effect were transmitted to their offspring, the child will have a genetic effect of $G_c=\frac{1}{2}A+\frac{1}{2}A'+D'$ where $A'$ is the additive genetic effect obtained from another parent by random and $D'$ is the non-additive genetic effect in the offspring.
	If we then consider the parent offspring covariance, we will get
	\begin{align}
	\mathrm{Cov_{OP}}&= \sum(\frac{1}{2}A+\frac{1}{2}A'+D')(A+D)\notag\\
	&=\frac{1}{2}\sum A^2+\frac{1}{2}\sum AD + \frac{1}{2}\sum A'(A+D) +D'(A+D) \notag\\ 
	&=\frac{1}{2}V_A+ \frac{1}{2}\mathrm{Cov}_{AD} + \frac{1}{2}\mathrm{Cov}_{A'A} + \frac{1}{2}\mathrm{Cov}_{A'D} +\mathrm{Cov}_{D'A} +\mathrm{Cov}_{D'D}  
	\label{eq:halfCompletedCovOP}
	\end{align} 
	Under the assumption of random mating,  $A'$ should be independent from $A$ and $D$. 
	On the other hand, as $D'$ was specific to the child, both of them should be independent from $A$ and $D$.
	Moreover, the covariance between the additive genetics and non-additive genetics should be zero\citep{Falconer1996}.
	Thus, \cref{eq:halfCompletedCovOP} becomes
	\begin{align}
	\mathrm{Cov_{OP}} &= \frac{1}{2}V_A+\mathrm{Cov}_{AD} \notag\\
	&= \frac{1}{2}V_A
	\label{eq:covOP}
	\end{align}
	Now if we assume the variance of phenotype of the parent and offspring were the same, then using \cref{eq:covOP}, we can obtain the narrow-sense heritability as
	\begin{align}
	h^2 &= \frac{1}{2}\frac{V_A}{\sigma_P^2}
	\label{eq:narrowHerit}
	\end{align}
	If we consider the simple linear regression equation $Y=X\beta+\epsilon$, its slope can be calculated as 
	$$
	\beta_{XY} = \frac{\mathrm{Cov}_{XY}}{\sigma_{X}{Y}}
	$$
	which resemble \cref{eq:narrowHerit}. 
	Therefore,  we can calculate the narrow sense heritability as
	$$
	h^2 = 2\beta_{OP}
	\label{eq:narrowSenseHerit}
	$$
	where $\beta_{OP}$ is the slope of the simple linear regression regressing the phenotype of an offspring to the phenotype of \emph{one} of its parents.
	We can further generalize \cref{eq:narrowSenseHerit} to all possible relativeness 
	$$
	h^2=\frac{\beta_{XY}}{r}
	\label{eq:finalNarrow}
	$$
	where $r$ is the relativeness of $X$ and $Y$.
	
	When the relativeness of the samples was known, one can then easily calculate the narrow senese heritability using \cref{eq:finalNarrow}.
	However, in the case of discontinuous trait (e.g. disease status) the calculation becomes more completed because the variance of the phenotype was dependent on the population prevalence.
	As \cref{eq:finalNarrow} does not account for the trait prevalence, it cannot be directly applied to discontinuous traits.
	In order to perform heritability estimation, we will need the concept of liability threshold model popularized by \cite{Falconer1965}.
	
	\section{Liability Threshold}
	According the central limit theorem, if a phenotype is determined by a multitude of genetics and environmental factors with relatively small effect, then its distribution will likely follow a normal distribution as is the case of many quantitative traits\citep{Visscher2008}. % No, what if there is interaction between variables? Then it will break the CLT
	The variance of phenotype can therefore be calculated as the variance under the normal distribution.
	However, such is not the case for disease such as \glng{scz} where instead of having a continuous distribution of phenotype, only a dichotomous labeling of ``affected'' and ``normal'' were obtained.
	The variance of these phenotype were therefore more difficult to obtain.
	
	\citet{Falconer1965} proposed the liability threshold model, which suggesting that these discontinuous traits also follow a continuous distribution with an additional parameter called the ``liability threshold''.
	Under the liability threshold model, the discontinuous traits were also affected by combination of many genetics and environmental factors, each with a small effects, as in the case of the continuous traits.
	The main difference was that the phenotype of an individual is determined by whether if the combined effects of these factors(``liability'') were above a particular threshold (``liability threshold'').
	So for example, in the case of \glng{scz}, only when an individual has a liability above the liability threshold will he/she be affected.
	
	% How to apply liability threshold together with heritability estimation
	% More detail of the liability threshold model
	% Then the application in schizophrenia
	% Then Twin studies
	
	
	
	\section{Twin Studies of Schizophrenia}
	% Need to go deeper into twin studies
	\sectionmark{Twin Studies of \glng{scz}}
	
	% What is heritability?
	% What are the different form of heritabilities?
	% What are the use of heritability? (Why do we want to calculate it)
	% How to calculate it?
	% Problems with heritability?
	
	% Heritability estimation in Schizophrenia
	% Twin studies -> Some reviews
	% Then the meta analysis
	% Then to Ben Ben's study (Family Based population study)
	% Explain the difference
	% Research in schziphrenia
	% Risk factors
	
	To find out whether if genetic or environment were the main mediator in \glng{scz}, researchers conducted varies twin and adoption studies. 
	% Here, we need to introduce Twin Studies
	% Then we need to introduce the liability model
	In one of the landmark study conducted by \cite{Sullivan2003}, a quantitative meta-analysis was performed on 12 published \glng{scz} twin studies.
	They found that although there was a non-zero contribution of environmental influence on liability of \glng{scz} ($11\%$,\gls{ci}=$3\%-19\%$), there was a much larger contribution from genetics ($81\%$, \gls{ci}=$73\%-90\%$), suggesting that \glng{scz} was largely mediated by the genetic elements.
	
	Such findings were not limited to twin-studies but were also reported in large scale population based studies.
	A recent large scale population based study in Sweden population\citep{Lichtenstein2009} also found that there was a large genetic contribution in \glng{scz} ($64\%$).
	Although a different estimation of heritability were obtained from the two studies, there is no doubt that \glng{scz} is highly heritable, justify the initiative of conducting genetic research in elucidating genetic risk factor of \glng{scz}.

	Although it was clear that \glng{scz} is a genetic disease, family studies shown that it is unlikely for \glng{scz} to be affected by genes with a large effect.
	Specifically, shall \glng{scz} be a Mendelian disorder, then we would expect all monozygotic siblings of the proband to also suffer from \glng{scz}.
	However, studies found that the life time morbid risk of monozyogitc twins were only $48\%$(\cref{fig:lifeMRscz})\citep{gottesman1991schizophrenia}, making it unlikely for \glng{scz} to follow a Mendelian pattern.
	
	Based on these observations, \cite{Gottesman1967} proposed that \glng{scz} follows a polygenic model where disease phenotype were determined by the additive effects from multiple genes.
	Thus, \glng{scz} is a complex genetic disorder with complicated pattern of inheritance. 
	Their hypothesis was supported by the calculation of \cite{Risch1990a} by taking into account of different inheritance model and the life time morbid risk observed in relatives of affected individuals.
	
	Another interesting conclusion from the calculation of \cite{Risch1990a} was the effect size of individual locus. 
	By comparing the observed life time morbid risk and the calculated risk from different models, it was observed that the model with a maximum risk of $\sim\le2$ was more compatible than that with risk $\ge3$.
	Thus, not only is \glng{scz} polygenic, the effect size of each individual causal genes are likely to be small (less than 2 fold risk elevation).

	Considerable research effort has been made in past years, aiming to identify the susceptible genes of \glng{scz}.
	However, early linkage studies were unable to capture the small effects and largely return with inconsistent results\citep{Harrison2005}. 
	As technology progress, large scale hypothesis free testings such as that of \gls{GWAS} starts to become available.

	\section{Brain development and Schizophrenia}
	\sectionmark{Brain development}
	Here we will perform the WGCNA and brain development network.
	Seeing how the whether if any brain development network were enriched with SNPs that explain the variance of phenotype
	%Instead, we should put most focus here as no one has done it before
	%Also descript brainspan here
	\subsection{Methodology}
	\subsubsection{Sample Quality Controls}
	We obtain the developmental transcriptome data from BrainSpan (\url{http://www.brainspan.org/}). 
	A total of 56 samples with different age were provided by BrainSpan with an average of 2.2 samples per age.
	
	Studies suggested Hippocampus\citep{Velakoulis2006,Nugent2007}, Amygdala and Striatum\citep{Simpson2010} are brain regions involved in the etiology of schizophrenia. 
	Therefore, we focus on building the gene co-expression network of hippocampus, amygdala and striatum in this study
	It is worth noting that the Pre-frontal Cortex is also important for schizophrenia. 
	However, as there isn't a well defined pre-frontal cortex samples from BrainSpan, we did not include the pre-frontal cortex in the current study.
	RNA Sequencing data of the brain regions were obtained from BrainSpan and undergo a series of quality control before the construction of the network. 
	 
	For each sample age, when there are more than one samples, we select the sample with a dissection score $\ge3$ and an \gls{rin} $\ge7$. 
	As some developmental stage only got 1 sample passing the quality check, we limit each developmental stage to have a maximum of 1 sample such that the final network will not be driven by a particular developmental stage. 
	If multiple samples passed through the quality check threshold, we will prefer sample with higher dissection score. 
	Shall multiple samples have the same dissection score, we will select the one with the highest \gls{rin}. 
	And if the samples have the same dissection score and \gls{rin} value, we will randomly select one for the network construction.
	
	After performing the quality control, a total of 16, 18 and 15 samples were selected for hippocampus, amygdala and striatum respectively.
	The sample age ranged from \gls{gd}8 to 23 years old representing the fetal developmental stage till the age of onset of schizophrenia.
	
	\subsubsection{Normalization of data}
	The RNA Sequencing data were represented as \gls{rpkm} values. 
	Genes with a low \gls{rpkm} can usually be a result from technical or biological noise\citep{Hart2013}.
	To reduce noise in the final model, genes with a mean \gls{rpkm} $< 1$ in all samples were discarded. 
	The \gls{rpkm} were then log transformed as instructed by the manual of \gls{wgcna}\citep{Langfelder2008}.
	
	As there are insufficient samples for the construction of gene co-expression network for individual sample age, we try to construct networks with genes co-expressed through all sample stage. 
	This is achieved by taking the standardized log$_2$ \gls{rpkm} across sample age such that all genes has a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.
	
	At the end, there were 17,168 genes, 17,038 genes and 17,166 genes passing through the quality threshold and were used for the construction of co-expression network in hippocampus, amygdala and striatum respectively. 
	 
	\subsubsection{Network Construction}
	\gls{wgcna} (ver 1.47) were used for the construction of gene co-expression network\citep{Langfelder2008}. 
	The \emph{blockwiseModules} function, using Biweight Midcorrelation for the construction of correlation matrix and a restriction of minimum network size of 30. 
	For the construction of gene co-expression networks in hippocampus, the soft-power threshold were set to 15 where it is the first threshold value which has $R^2 > 0.8$ (0.817) and the $R^2$ is saturated\citep{Zhang2005}.%(\cref{fig:softpowerThreshold})
	As for striatum, the soft-power threshold were set to 20. 
	Again, this is the first threshold value with $R^2 >0.8$ (0.879) and where the $R^2$ is saturated.
	
	On the other hand, for amygdala, soft-power threshold were set to 9 which is the first threshold for $R^2$ to reach saturation. 
	However, with a soft-power threshold of 9, the $R^2$ were only 0.776, which is lower than the recommended 0.8 threshold.
	The reason behind this decision was that the first soft-power threshold to have $R^2 > 0.8$ is 30.
	Under this threshold, the mean connectivity of the resulting networks will be around 23.6 with a median connectivity of 2.51.
	Such level of connectivity will likely yield networks that are too small to useful.
	If one would like to satisfy both requirement of threshold selection, a threshold $>30$ are likely required and any networks constructed will likely to be small.
	As a result of that, we select threshold of 9 where networks with reasonable size can be constructed.
	
	%\begin{figure}
	%	\caption[Soft-power threshold selection]{Soft-power threshold selection. A soft-power of 13 were selected as it is the first threshold value having $R^2 > 0.8$ (0.817) and where the $R^2$ is saturated.}

	%	\scalebox{.8}{\includegraphics{figure/SoftpowerThreshold.png}}
	%	\label{fig:softpowerThreshold}
	%\end{figure}
	
	\subsubsection{Expression correlation with Age}
	The co-expression network constructed with the standardized gene expression value will contains genes that co-express in all sample age.
	However, this does not necessary suggest the expression of these genes are correlated with the sample age.
	To identify gene co-expression networks with expressions correlated with the sample age, we performed a correlation analysis between the module eigen-genes and the sample age. 
	Network eigen-genes were calculated as the first \gls{pc} of expressions of the genes within individual networks using the \emph{moduleEigengenes} function from \gls{wgcna}. 
	Age were represented as month from conception such that 8 post-conception week will be represented as 2; 4 months will be represented as 10 and 12 years will be represented as 154 etc. 
	Finally, correlation between age and network eigen-gene expression were calculated pearson correlation.
	
	\subsubsection{Functional Annotation}
	\gls{GO} based enrichment analysis of the significant module was performed using GOrilla\citep{Eden2009}.
	Genes within the networks were provide as the target gene lists and all the genes passed quality controls were used as the background gene list.
	As \gls{GO} terms tends to be redundant and overlaps with each other, it will aid the interpretation of \gls{GO} results based by clustering and reducing the \gls{GO} terms based on their similarity. 
	Thus, \gls{GO} enrichment results were summerized by REViGO\citep{Supek2011} and significant representative \gls{GO} terms were obtained.
	
	\subsubsection{Associate Co-expression network with \glsentryshort{pgc} schizophrenia data}
	The co-expression networks were built from normal samples and should not be representative of the brain expression pattern in schizophrenia patients.
	it is however interesting to see if the co-expression networks were disrupted in schizophrenia patient.
	To test whether if the gene co-expression networks contain genes that are jointly associated with schizophrenia, we first use \gls{MAGMA}\citep{DeLeeuw2015}(version v1.03) to compute the gene-base p-value from the \gls{SNP} wise p-value obtained from \gls{pgc}. 
	Gene-set enrichment analysis were then performed on networks that were significantly correlated with developmental age. 
	As we were only interested in whether if the genes within the networks were jointly associated with schizophrenia, we only focus on the result of the self-contained gene set analysis and ignore the result from competitive analysis.
	
	\subsubsection{Partitioning of Heritability}
	
	\subsection{Result}
	\subsubsection{Co-Expression Network}
	A total of 35 networks were constructed based on the hippocampus samples with a mean network size of 421.6.
	On the other hand, 28 networks were constructed for amygdala with mean network size of 591.86.
	Finally, 25 networks with mean size of 494.52 were constructed from the striatum samples.
	
	Of the all the networks constructed, only one network from hippocampus(\cref{tab:hipModSig}) and three networks from amygdala(\cref{tab:amyModSig}) were significantly correlated with sample age after bonferroni correction threshold (p-value $<0.00143$ for hippocampus, p-value $<0.00179$ for amygdala and p-value $<0.002$ for striatum) .

	By plotting the mean expression of each network against the sample age, one can inspect how the dynamic of the network changes across different developmental stage.
	Thus, mean expression of all the genes within the significant networks were calculated for all amygdala (n=33) and hippocampus (n=32) samples from BrainSpan.
	The mean \gls{rpkm} values were then log$_2$ transformed and plot against the sample age where a line of bests fit was calculated using the \emph{stat\_smooth} with the loess function from R package \emph{ggplot2}(version 1.0.1). (\cref{fig:allMod}).
	
	The expression pattern observed were intriguing where there both the ``black''(\cref{fig:blackMod}) and ``tan'' (\cref{fig:tanMod}) networks have mean gene expression level increase as development progress and reaches its peak at around late adolescence ($\approx 18-21$), concurring with the onset age of schizophrenia.
	Similarly, an inverse pattern were observed with the ``yellow'' network where its mean expression was highest during fetal development and drop steadily to its lowest around late adolescence and increase again afterwards(\cref{fig:yellowMod}).
	
	The expression pattern of the ``black'' and ``tan'' networks are of particular interest as they follow the inverted ``U'' shape trajectory of the grey matter volumn observed in previous studies\citep{Gogtay2011}, suggest that they might have a role in mediating brain development.

	\subsubsection{Functional Annotation}
	Upon performing the \gls{GO} enrichment analysis, a total of 16 \gls{GO} terms were enriched in the ``black'' hippocampus network, 4 in the ``tan'' amygdala network and 45 in the ``yellow'' amygdala network. 
	No \gls{GO} term was enriched in the ``pink'' amygdala network.
	
	The enriched \gls{GO} terms of the ``yellow'' amygdala network were mainly related to translation and transcription and were not specific to brain function or development(\cref{tab:yellowGO}). 
	On the contrary, the \gls{GO} terms enriched in the ``black'' hippocampus network were highly relevant to brain function and development (\cref{tab:blackGO})(e.g. ``central nervous system development'' and ``glutamate metabolic process'') and the ``tan'' amygdala network were also related to ammonium ion metabolism (\cref{tab:tanGO}) which is vita for glutamine synthesis from glutamate\citep{Liaw1995}. 
	
	Together, it is highly likely that the ``black'' hippocampus and ``tan'' amygdala networks are related to brain development and function.

			Surprisingly, \gls{GO} related to immune systems were also observed ``positive regulation of production of molecular mediator of immune response''.

	\subsubsection{Associate Co-expression network with \glsentryshort{pgc} schizophrenia data}
	Although the co-expression network were extremely interesting for their expression pattern and functional enrichment in brain development and function related \gls{GO} terms, there were no evidence of their involvement nor importance in schizophrenia.
	Therefore it is of particular interest for us to test whether if genes within these co-expression networks were associated withs schizophrenia. 
	
	First, gene base p-value of 18,622 genes were calculated using p-values from the \gls{pgc} schizophrenia working group\citep{Ripke2014}.
	Gene set enrichment analysis were then performed using \gls{MAGMA}\citep{DeLeeuw2015} to test whether if there genes within the ``black'' hippocampus and ``tan'' amygdala networks were significantly associated with schizophrenia.
	
	Based on the self-contained gene set enrichment analysis, genes within both networks were significantly associated with schizophrenia with p-value of $1.38\times 10^{-41}$ for the ``tan'' amygdala network and $2.70\times 10{-74}$ for the ``black'' hippocampus network.
	These suggest that these networks might be disrupted in schizophrenia patients.

	\hat{Y} = diag(\beta)X
	\end{equation}
	where $X$ is the standardized genotype, $\beta$ is the test-statistic calculated from other studies.
