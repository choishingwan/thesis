\chapter{General Introduction and literature review (What has been done)}

\section{Neurodevelopmental disorders}
\input{general_introduction/gi_neurodevelopmentalDisorders.tex}
To understand these disorders, researchers conduct different studies
\section{Contribution of Genetic and Environmental risk factors}
\subsection{Epidemiological studies}
Looking into records
Find out what is common between the people
e.g. alcohol use, prenatal infection

Here we will discuss how different environmental risk factors were considered as risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. Etiological studies)
\subsection{Postnatal stress}
\subsection{Maternal use of alcohol}
\subsection{Socio-economical status}
\subsection{Age of parents}
\subsection{Maternal immune activation}
At the end, we would like to comparing different environmental risk factors and then say that maternal immune activation were the most interested as this is the single biggest risk factor

\subsection{Twin Studies}
Only small amount of similarity between the environmental factors
Will there be anything other than environment?
Use twins studies to find out.

\section{Genetic Risk Factors}
Now we know genetic is the main factor, how to study it?
And also how people study the role of genetics in a disease.
So basically, will have brief discussion on gwas, exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing
\subsection{Common Single Nucleotide Polymorphism}
\subsubsection{Genome-wide association studies}
\subsection{Rare Single Nucleotide Mutation}
\subsection{Copy Number Variation (CNV)}
