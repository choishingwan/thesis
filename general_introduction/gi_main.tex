\section{Contribution of Genetic and Environmental risk factors}
Will have to discuss how a disease comprise of genetic and environmental risk factors.
The twin study will be the starting point.
Should discuss based on the neurodevelopmental disorders
\subsection{Twin Studies}
\section{Environmental Risk factors}
\input{general_introduction/gi_environmentalRiskFactors.tex}
\section{Genetic Risk Factors}
Here we talk about how genetic can lead to diseases.
And also how people study the role of genetics in a disease.
So basically, will have brief discussion on gwas, exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing
