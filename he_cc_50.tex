				The performance of \gls{gcta} was as suggested by \citet{Golan2014} where there was an underestimation as prevalence decreases.
				On the other hand, \gls{ldsc} were upwardly biased when a fixed intercept was used and this bias was corrected when an estimation of intercept was allowed.
				\gls{shrek} does not seems to as sensitive to change in prevalence and the estimation were relatively robust.

				It was clear that the prevalence affects the variance of estimation where a larger variance tends to increase the variance of estimation.
				Again, \gls{gcta} has the lowest variance, however, unlike in the quantitative trait simulation, \gls{shrek} has a lower average variance when compared to \gls{ldsc} with fixed intercept.
				Nonetheless, it was important to remember that in case control simulation, a much smaller amount of \glspl{SNP} was used, thus the results was not directly comparable to results from the quantitative simulation.

				From the quantitative trait simulation with random effect size(\cref{fig:QtRandVarCom}), it was observed that the variance estimation of \gls{shrek} and \gls{gcta} were rater accurate.
				Similarly, in the case control simulation with 500 causal \glspl{SNP}, it was observed that the variance estimation of \gls{shrek} and \gls{gcta} were close to the empirical variance with slight bias.
				A large up-ward bias was observed for \gls{ldsc} with fixed intercept estimation but the bias was less when \gls{ldsc} was allowed to estimate the intercept.s
