abstract = {Apolipoprotein E, type epsilon 4 allele (APOE epsilon 4), is associated with late-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is high avidity and specific binding of amyloid beta-peptide with the protein ApoE. To test the hypothesis that late-onset familial AD may represent the clustering of sporadic AD in families large enough to be studied, we extended the analyses of APOE alleles to several series of sporadic AD patients. APOE epsilon 4 is significantly associated with a series of probable sporadic AD patients (0.36 +/- 0.042, AD, versus 0.16 +/- 0.027, controls [allele frequency estimate +/- standard error], p = 0.00031). Spouse controls did not differ from CEPH grandparent controls from the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) or from literature controls. A large combined series of autopsy-documented sporadic AD patients also demonstrated highly significant association with the APOE epsilon 4 allele (0.40 +/- 0.026, p < or = 0.00001). These data support the involvement of ApoE epsilon 4 in the pathogenesis of late-onset familial and sporadic AD. ApoE isoforms may play an important role in the metabolism of beta-peptide, and APOE epsilon 4 may operate as a susceptibility gene (risk factor) for the clinical expression of AD.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies for complex traits are based on the common disease/common variant (CDCV) and common disease/rare variant (CDRV) assumptions. Under the CDCV hypothesis, classical genome-wide association studies using single-marker tests are powerful in detecting common susceptibility variants, but under the CDRV hypothesis they are not as powerful. Several methods have been recently proposed to detect association with multiple rare variants collectively in a functional unit such as a gene. In this paper, we compare the relative performance of several of these methods on the Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 data. We evaluate these methods using the unrelated individual and family data sets. Association was tested using 200 replicates for the quantitative trait Q1. Although in these data the power to detect association is often low, our results show that collapsing methods are promising tools. However, we faced the challenge of assessing the proper type I error to validate our power comparisons. We observed that the type I error rate was not well controlled; however, we did not find a general trend specific to each method. Each method can be conservative or nonconservative depending on the studied gene. Our results also suggest that collapsing and the single-locus association approaches may not be affected to the same extent by population stratification. This deserves further investigation.},

Major efforts have been undertaken for capturing and representing experimental knowledge as manually drawn KEGG pathway maps and for genome-based generalization of experimental knowledge through the KEGG Orthology (KO) system. Current knowledge on diseases and drugs has also been integrated in the KEGG pathway maps, especially in terms of known disease genes and drug targets. Thus, KEGG can be used as a reference knowledge base for integration and interpretation of large-scale datasets generated by high-throughput experimental technologies, as well for finding their practical values. Here we give an introduction to the KEGG Mapper tools, especially for understanding disease mechanisms and adverse drug interactions.},

abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are part of a broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders known as pervasive developmental disorders, which occur in childhood. They are characterized by impairments in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication and the presence of restricted and repetitive stereotyped behaviors. At the present time, the etiology of ASD is largely unknown, but genetic, environmental, immunological, and neurological factors are thought to play a role in the development of ASD. Recently, increasing research has focused on the connections between the immune system and the nervous system, including its possible role in the development of ASD. These neuroimmune interactions begin early during embryogenesis and persist throughout an individual's lifetime, with successful neurodevelopment contingent upon a normal balanced immune response. Immune aberrations consistent with a dysregulated immune response, which so far, have been reported in autistic children, include abnormal or skewed T helper cell type 1 (T(H)1)/T(H)2 cytokine profiles, decreased lymphocyte numbers, decreased T cell mitogen response, and the imbalance of serum immunoglobulin levels. In addition, autism has been linked with autoimmunity and an association with immune-based genes including human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 and complement C4 alleles described. There is potential that such aberrant immune activity during vulnerable and critical periods of neurodevelopment could participate in the generation of neurological dysfunction characteristic of ASD. This review will examine the status of the research linking the immune response with ASD.},

abstract = {Transcription factors of the achaete-scute and atonal bHLH proneural gene family play important roles in neuronal differentiation. They are also involved in neuronal subtype specification through collaboration with homeodomain (HD) transcription factors. However, concerted regulation of these genes and in turn progenitor fate toward distinct lineages within the developing vertebrate brain is not well understood. Fezf2 is an evolutionarily conserved zinc finger protein important for monoaminergic neuronal development in zebrafish. Here, we show that Fezf2 is also critical for GABAergic neuronal fate and investigate how a single transcription factor regulates the identity of multiple neuronal lineages in the developing ventral forebrain. First, our genetic analyses reveal the requirement of the achaete-scute-like genes ascl1a and 1b in serotonergic and GABAergic neuron development, but they are dispensable for the specification of dopaminergic neurons, which is dependent on the atonal-like gene neurog1. Second, the expression of fezf2, ascl1a/1b, and neurog1 demarcates distinct progenitor subpopulations, where fezf2 is required for activating but not maintaining the expression of bHLH genes. Third, Fezf2 is required to activate HD genes otpb and dlx2, which are involved in dopaminergic and GABAergic neuronal development, respectively. Finally, we uncover that Fezf2 is sufficient to increase dopaminergic neuronal numbers but not serotonergic or GABAergic lineages. Together, these findings reveal new mechanisms by which multilineage differentiation is coordinately regulated by a single transcription factor in the vertebrate ventral forebrain.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of using the Amigo Remote Catheter System (RCS) in arrhythmia ablation procedures. Because Amigo allows the physician to operate all catheter function outside of the radiation field, operator exposure time was also evaluated. This is a nonrandomized, prospective clinical trial conducted at 1 site (identifier: NCT01834872). The study prospectively enrolled 50 consecutive patients (mean age 59 +/- 15 years, 72{\%} men) with any type of arrhythmia (23 atrial fibrillation ablation, 12 common atrial flutters, 10 patients with other supraventricular tachycardia, 4 ventricular tachycardia, and 1 patient with palpitations with no arrhythmia induced) referred for catheter ablation, in which we used RCS. Fifty matched ablation procedures (mean age 57 +/- 14 years, 70{\%} men) performed during the same time period, without RCS, were enrolled into the control group. Acute ablation success was 96{\%} with RCS and 98{\%} in the manual group. In only 2 cases, the physician switched to manual ablation (1 ventricular tachycardia and 1 accessory pathway) to complete the procedure. There were no complications related to the use of RCS. No differences were observed in total procedure time, total fluoroscopy time, or total radiofrequency delivery compared with the manual group. In procedures performed with RCS, the operator's fluoroscopy exposure time was reduced by 68 +/- 16{\%}. In conclusion, arrhythmia ablation with RCS is safe and feasible. Furthermore, it significantly reduces operator's exposure to radiation.},

abstract = {Maternal infection is a risk factor for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SZ). Indeed, modeling this risk factor in mice through maternal immune activation (MIA) causes ASD- and SZ-like neuropathologies and behaviors in the offspring. Although MIA upregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines in the fetal brain, whether MIA leads to long-lasting changes in brain cytokines during postnatal development remains unknown. Here, we tested this possibility by measuring protein levels of 23 cytokines in the blood and three brain regions from offspring of poly(I:C)- and saline-injected mice at five postnatal ages using multiplex arrays. Most cytokines examined are present in sera and brains throughout development. MIA induces changes in the levels of many cytokines in the brains and sera of offspring in a region- and age-specific manner. These MIA-induced changes follow a few, unexpected and distinct patterns. In frontal and cingulate cortices, several, mostly pro-inflammatory, cytokines are elevated at birth, followed by decreases during periods of synaptogenesis and plasticity, and increases again in the adult. Cytokines are also altered in postnatal hippocampus, but in a pattern distinct from the other regions. The MIA-induced changes in brain cytokines do not correlate with changes in serum cytokines from the same animals. Finally, these MIA-induced cytokine changes are not accompanied by breaches in the blood-brain barrier, immune cell infiltration or increases in microglial density. Together, these data indicate that MIA leads to long-lasting, region-specific changes in brain cytokines in offspring-similar to those reported for ASD and SZ-that may alter CNS development and behavior. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Schizophrenic patients show lower incidences of cancer, implicating schizophrenia may be a protective factor against cancer. To study the genetic correlation between the two diseases, a specific PPI network was constructed with candidate genes of both schizophrenia and hepatocellular carcinoma. The network, designated schizophrenia-hepatocellular carcinoma network (SHCN), was analysed and cliques were identified as potential functional modules or complexes. The findings were compared with information from pathway databases such as KEGG, Reactome, PID and ConsensusPathDB. RESULTS: The functions of mediator genes from SHCN show immune system and cell cycle regulation have important roles in the eitology mechanism of schizophrenia. For example, the over-expressing schizophrenia candidate genes, SIRPB1, SYK and LCK, are responsible for signal transduction in cytokine production; immune responses involving IL-2 and TREM-1/DAP12 pathways are relevant for the etiology mechanism of schizophrenia. Novel treatments were proposed by searching the target genes of FDA approved drugs with genes in potential protein complexes and pathways. It was found that Vitamin A, retinoid acid and a few other immune response agents modulated by RARA and LCK genes may be potential treatments for both schizophrenia and hepatocellular carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study showing specific mediator genes in the SHCN which may suppress tumors. We also show that the schizophrenic protein interactions and modulation with cancer implicates the importance of immune system for etiology of schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Epidemiological studies indicate that among other early life challenges, maternal infection with influenza during pregnancy increased the risk of developing schizophrenia in the child. One morphological manifestation of schizophrenia is hippocampal atrophy. In the hippocampus, playing a key role in learning and memory formation, new granule cell neurons are produced throughout life from resident precursor cells. We hypothesize that individuals exposed to a maternal anti-viral immune response would presumably enter life with a challenged neural precursor cell pool and might later be susceptible to psychiatric pathologies due to reduced adult neurogenesis. We used the injection of double-stranded RNA (polyriboinosinicpolyribocytidylic acid - PolyI:C) in pregnant C57Bl/6 and nestin-GFP reporter mice to induce a maternal viral-like infection and schizophrenia-like behavior in the offspring. In the progeny we found impairments in the open field test and in sensorimotor gating as measured by pre-pulse inhibition of the startle response. The behavioral deficits were accompanied by reduced baseline adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Telomerase activity in neural precursor cells was reduced from birth on and telomere shortening was found in the same cell type in adult life. When we subjected the progeny of viral-like infected dams to voluntary exercise, a known stimulus of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, we could rescue the phenotype in behavior, adult neurogenesis, and cellular senescence. In summary, maternal viral-like immune response reduced telomerase activity and resulted in telomere shortening in neural precursor cells. Further we demonstrate that beneficial behavioral and cellular effects induced by exercise can be studied in a rodent model of schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Microglia, the resident CNS macrophages, represent about 10{\%} of the adult brain cell population. Although described a long time ago, their origin and developmental lineage is still debated. While del Rio-Hortega suggested that microglia originate from meningeal macrophages penetrating the brain during embryonic development, many authors claim that brain parenchymal microglia derive from circulating blood monocytes originating from bone marrow. We have previously reported that the late embryonic and adult mouse brain parenchyma contains potential microglial progenitors [F. Alliot, E. Lecain, B. Grima, B. Pessac, Microglial progenitors with a high proliferative capacity in the embryonic and the adult mouse brain, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88 (1991) 1541-1545]. We now report that they can be detected in the brain rudiment from embryonic day 8, after their appearance in the yolk sac and that their number increases until late gestation. We also show that microglia appear during embryonic development and that their number increases steadily during the first two postnatal weeks, when about 95{\%} of microglia are born. Finally, the main finding of this study is that microglia is the result of in situ proliferation, as shown by the high proportion of parenchymal microglial cells that express PCNA, a marker of cell multiplication, in embryonic and postnatal brain. Taken together, our data support the hypothesis that terminally differentiated brain parenchymal microglia are derived from cells originating from the yolk sac whose progeny actively proliferates in situ during development.},

abstract = {Overactivity of the dopaminergic system in the brain is considered to be a contributing factor to the development and symptomatology of schizophrenia. Therefore, the GABAergic control of dopamine functions was assessed by disrupting the gene encoding the alpha3 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor. alpha3 knockout (alpha3KO) mice exhibited neither an obvious developmental defect nor apparent morphological brain abnormalities, and there was no evidence for compensatory up-regulation of other major GABA(A)-receptor subunits. Anxiety-related behavior in the elevated-plus-maze test was undisturbed, and the anxiolytic-like effect of diazepam, which is mediated by alpha2-containing GABA(A) receptors, was preserved. As a result of the loss of alpha3 GABA(A) receptors, the GABA-induced whole-cell current recorded from midbrain dopamine neurons was significantly reduced. Spontaneous locomotor activity was slightly elevated in alpha3KO mice. Most notably, prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex was markedly attenuated in the alpha3KO mice, pointing to a deficit in sensorimotor information processing. This deficit was completely normalized by treatment with the antipsychotic D2-receptor antagonist haloperidol. The amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion was not altered in alpha3KO mice compared with WT mice. These results suggest that the absence of alpha3-subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors induces a hyperdopaminergic phenotype, including a severe deficit in sensorimotor gating, a common feature among psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia. Hence, agonists acting at alpha3-containing GABA(A) receptors may constitute an avenue for an effective treatment of sensorimotor-gating deficits in various psychiatric conditions.},

abstract = {For most human complex diseases and traits, SNPs identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) explain only a small fraction of the heritability. Here we report a user-friendly software tool called genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA), which was developed based on a method we recently developed to address the "missing heritability" problem. GCTA estimates the variance explained by all the SNPs on a chromosome or on the whole genome for a complex trait rather than testing the association of any particular SNP to the trait. We introduce GCTA's five main functions: data management, estimation of the genetic relationships from SNPs, mixed linear model analysis of variance explained by the SNPs, estimation of the linkage disequilibrium structure, and GWAS simulation. We focus on the function of estimating the variance explained by all the SNPs on the X chromosome and testing the hypotheses of dosage compensation. The GCTA software is a versatile tool to estimate and partition complex trait variation with large GWAS data sets.},

In the fully-developed brain, these same pathways that impact microtubule function mediate at least some aspects of experience-dependent plasticity, which may also be impaired in schizophrenia. Whereas severe presentations of "lissencephaly" are associated with mutations and deletions of DISC1, LIS1 and the gene for the very low-density lipoprotein receptor, genetic variations of these loci are good candidate schizophrenia genes. Importantly, in the fully-developed brain, there is a possibility that at least some of the consequences of these disturbed genetic pathways that adversely affect microtubule function may be "bypassed" or mitigated.},

abstract = {AMIGO-1 is the parent member of a novel family of three cell surface leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins. Its expression is induced by the binding of HMGB1 (high-mobility group box 1 protein) to RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products) on neurons. Binding of HMGB1 to RAGE is known to have a direct effect on cellular growth regulation and mobility, and AMIGO-1 directly supports growth of neuronal processes and fasciculation of neurites. In addition, the second member of the AMIGO-family, AMIGO-2, has been implicated in adhesion of tumor cells in adenocarcinoma and survival of neurons. We have determined the crystal structure of AMIGO-1 at 2.0 A resolution, which reveals a typical cell surface LRR domain arrangement with N- and C-terminal capping domains with disulfide bridges, followed by a C2-type Ig domain. AMIGO-1 is a dimer, with the LRR regions forming the dimer interface, and sequence conservation analysis and static light-scattering measurements suggest that all three AMIGO family proteins form similar dimers. Based on the AMIGO-1 structure, we have also modeled AMIGO-2 and present small-angle X-ray scattering data on AMIGO-2 and AMIGO-3. Our mutagenesis studies show that AMIGO-1 dimerization is necessary for proper cell surface expression and thus probably for proper or stable folding in the endoplastic reticulum and for the function of the protein. Based on the data presented earlier, we also suggest that dimerization through the LRR-LRR interface is likely to be involved in cell-cell adhesion by AMIGO-1, while extensive glycosylation may have a role.},

@article{Miller2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genomic and other high dimensional analyses often require one to summarize multiple related variables by a single representative. This task is also variously referred to as collapsing, combining, reducing, or aggregating variables. Examples include summarizing several probe measurements corresponding to a single gene, representing the expression profiles of a co-expression module by a single expression profile, and aggregating cell-type marker information to de-convolute expression data. Several standard statistical summary techniques can be used, but network methods also provide useful alternative methods to find representatives. Currently few collapsing functions are developed and widely applied. RESULTS: We introduce the R function collapseRows that implements several collapsing methods and evaluate its performance in three applications. First, we study a crucial step of the meta-analysis of microarray data: the merging of independent gene expression data sets, which may have been measured on different platforms. Toward this end, we collapse multiple microarray probes for a single gene and then merge the data by gene identifier. We find that choosing the probe with the highest average expression leads to best between-study consistency. Second, we study methods for summarizing the gene expression profiles of a co-expression module. Several gene co-expression network analysis applications show that the optimal collapsing strategy depends on the analysis goal. Third, we study aggregating the information of cell type marker genes when the aim is to predict the abundance of cell types in a tissue sample based on gene expression data ("expression deconvolution"). We apply different collapsing methods to predict cell type abundances in peripheral human blood and in mixtures of blood cell lines. Interestingly, the most accurate prediction method involves choosing the most highly connected "hub" marker gene. Finally, to facilitate biological interpretation of collapsed gene lists, we introduce the function userListEnrichment, which assesses the enrichment of gene lists for known brain and blood cell type markers, and for other published biological pathways. CONCLUSIONS: The R function collapseRows implements several standard and network-based collapsing methods. In various genomic applications we provide evidence that both types of methods are robust and biologically relevant tools.},

abstract = {The Schizophrenia Psychiatric Genome-Wide Association Study Consortium (PGC) highlighted 81 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with moderate evidence for association to schizophrenia. After follow-up in independent samples, seven loci attained genome-wide significance (GWS), but multi-locus tests suggested some SNPs that did not do so represented true associations. We tested 78 of the 81 SNPs in 2640 individuals with a clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia attending a clozapine clinic (CLOZUK), 2504 cases with a research diagnosis of bipolar disorder, and 2878 controls. In CLOZUK, we obtained significant replication to the PGC-associated allele for no fewer than 37 (47{\%}) of the SNPs, including many prior GWS major histocompatibility complex (MHC) SNPs as well as 3/6 non-MHC SNPs for which we had data that were reported as GWS by the PGC. After combining the new schizophrenia data with those of the PGC, variants at three loci (ITIH3/4, CACNA1C and SDCCAG8) that had not previously been GWS in schizophrenia attained that level of support. In bipolar disorder, we also obtained significant evidence for association for 21{\%} of the alleles that had been associated with schizophrenia in the PGC. Our study independently confirms association to three loci previously reported to be GWS in schizophrenia, and identifies the first GWS evidence in schizophrenia for a further three loci. Given the number of independent replications and the power of our sample, we estimate 98{\%} (confidence interval (CI) 78-100{\%}) of the original set of 78 SNPs represent true associations. We also provide strong evidence for overlap in genetic risk between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.},

Enriched Gene Ontology categories among this set can sometimes point to the function of the gene. Seven organisms are currently supported (Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Mus musculus, Homo sapiens, Rattus norvegicus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and hundreds of data sets have been collected from GEO, BioGRID, IRefIndex and I2D, as well as organism-specific functional genomics data sets.

We report here that AMIGO is a glycosylated protein widely expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), and can be found in neurons, astrocytes as well as oligodendrocytes. In morphologically mature primary neurons, endogenous AMIGO, and transfected full length AMIGO (AMIGO-FL) are largely dendritic, while AMIGO with its LRR domain deleted (AMIGO-Ig) is predominantly axonal. In line with AMIGO's dendritic localization, siRNA-mediated silencing of AMIGO resulted in reduced dendritic growth of cortical neurons in culture. SH-SY5Y cells stably over-expressing AMIGO are more resistant to apoptosis induced by staurosporine and H(2) O(2) compared to vector controls. AMIGO therefore likely plays important roles in dendritic outgrowth during development, and could modulate the survival of developing and adult neurons.},

abstract = {The SLC1A2 gene encodes the excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2). Glutamate is the major mediator of excitatory neurotransmission and EAAT2 is responsible for clearing the neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft. Genetic variation in SLC1A2 has been implicated in a range of neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions including schizophrenia (SZ), autism and in core phenotypes of bipolar disorder (BD). The coding and putative regulatory regions of SLC1A2 gene were screened for variants using high resolution melting or sequenced in 1099 or in 32 BD subjects. Thirty-two variants were detected in the SLC1A2 gene. Fifteen potentially etiological variants were selected for genotyping in 1099 BD and 1095 control samples. Five amino acid changing variants were also genotyped in 630 participants suffering from SZ. None of the variants were found to be associated with BD or SZ or with the two diseases combined. However, two recurrent missense variants (rs145827578:G>A, p.(G6S); rs199599866:G>A, p.(R31Q)) and one recurrent 5'-untranslated region (UTR) variant (ss825678885:G>T) were detected in cases only. Combined analysis of the recurrent-case-only missense variants and of the case-only missense and 5'-UTR variants showed nominal evidence for association with the combined diseases (Fisher's P=0.019 and 0.0076). These findings are exploratory in nature and await replication in larger cohorts, however, they provide intriguing evidence that potentially functional rare variants in the SLC1A2 gene may confer susceptibility to psychotic disorders.European Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 19 November 2014; doi:10.1038/ejhg.2014.261.},

Loss of responsiveness to an eye deprived of vision can be initiated prematurely by enhancing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated transmission with benzodiazepines. Here, we use a mouse "knockin" mutation to alpha subunits that renders individual GABA type A (GABA(A)) receptors insensitive to diazepam to show that a particular inhibitory network controls expression of the critical period. Only alpha1-containing circuits were found to drive cortical plasticity, whereas alpha2-enriched connections separately regulated neuronal firing. This dissociation carries implications for models of brain development and the safe design of benzodiazepines for use in infants.},

abstract = {Recent investigation suggests a strong relationship between immunological effects and the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Two prevalent approaches exist to this association. First, is more empirical a-priori research investigating immunological changes prevalent in schizophrenia and the second approach is more hypothesis-driven with analysis of immunological changes in schizophrenia based on known irregularities of the illness. The former approach is based upon three predominant lines of investigation including observations of a diffuse non-specific overactivation of the immunological response system, of a T-helper cell type 1 immune activation and of a T-helper cell type 2 immune activation in subgroups of schizophrenia patients. These last two theories suggest that a subgroup of patients with schizophrenia may demonstrate features of an autoimmune process, a theory supported by a growing database of investigation. The latter approach notes that many observations of immune dysregulation in schizophrenia overlap with central etiopathophysiological mechanisms as well as with clinical manifestations of the illness. Immunotherapy offers the opportunity to modify or re-balance the immune system and may become useful in management of the illness. Given that autoimmune mechanisms could interrupt neurotransmission, any process interfering with this disruption including therapeutic antibodies to involved cytokines, or with various other natural autoantibodies or immune system regulators, may become useful in the augmentative management of the illness.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the etiopathology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is not clear, there is increasing evidence that dysfunction in the immune system affects many children with ASD. Findings of immune dysfunction in ASD include increases in inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and microglial activity in brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid, as well as abnormal peripheral immune cell function. METHODS: Adhesion molecules, such as platelet endothelial adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), P-selectin, and L-selectin, function to facilitate leukocyte transendothelial migration. We assessed concentrations of soluble adhesion molecules, sPECAM-1, sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, sP-selectin, and sL-selectin in the plasma of 49 participants with ASD and 31 typically developing controls of the same age, all of whom were enrolled as part of the Autism Phenome Project. Behavioral assessment, the levels of soluble adhesion molecules, and head circumference were compared in the same subjects. RESULTS: Levels of sPECAM-1 and sP-selectin were significantly reduced in the ASD group compared to typically developing controls (p < .02). Soluble PECAM-1 levels were negatively associated with repetitive behavior and abnormal brain growth in children with ASD (p = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Because adhesion molecules modulate the permeability and signaling at the blood-brain barrier as well as leukocyte infiltration into the central nervous system, the current data suggest a role for these molecules in the complex pathophysiology of ASD.},

CXCR4 and SDF1 are reported to be expressed in various tissues including brain. Here we show that SDF1 and CXCR4 are expressed in cultured cortical type I rat astrocytes, cortical neurons, and cerebellar granule cells. In cortical astrocytes, prolonged treatment with lipopolysaccharide induced an increase of SDF1 expression and a down-regulation of CXCR4, whereas treatment with phorbol esters did not affect SDF1 expression and down-modulated CXCR4 receptor expression. We also demonstrated the ability of human SDF1alpha (hSDF1alpha) to increase the intracellular calcium level in cultured astrocytes and cortical neurons, whereas in the same conditions, cerebellar granule cells did not modify their intracellular calcium concentration. Furthermore, in cortical astrocytes, the simultaneous treatment of hSDF1alpha with the HIV-1 capside glycoprotein gp120 inhibits the cyclic AMP formation induced by forskolin treatment.},

abstract = {Emerging researches point to a relevant role of postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins, such as PSD-95, Homer, Shank, and DISC-1, in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders. The PSD is a thickness, detectable at electronic microscopy, localized at the postsynaptic membrane of glutamatergic synapses, and made by scaffolding proteins, receptors, and effector proteins; it is considered a structural and functional crossroad where multiple neurotransmitter systems converge, including the dopaminergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic ones, which are all implicated in the pathophysiology of psychosis. Decreased PSD-95 protein levels have been reported in postmortem brains of schizophrenia patients. Variants of Homer1, a key PSD protein for glutamate signaling, have been associated with schizophrenia symptoms severity and therapeutic response. Mutations in Shank gene have been recognized in autism spectrum disorder patients, as well as reported to be associated to behaviors reminiscent of schizophrenia symptoms when expressed in genetically engineered mice. Here, we provide a critical appraisal of PSD proteins role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders. Then, we discuss how antipsychotics may affect PSD proteins in brain regions relevant to psychosis pathophysiology, possibly by controlling synaptic plasticity and dendritic spine rearrangements through the modulation of glutamate-related targets. We finally provide a framework that may explain how PSD proteins might be useful candidates to develop new therapeutic approaches for schizophrenia and related disorders in which there is a need for new biological treatments, especially against some symptom domains, such as negative symptoms, that are poorly affected by current antipsychotics.},

abstract = {A common pathological finding in autism is a localized deficit in Purkinje cells (PCs). Cerebellar abnormalities have also been reported in schizophrenia. Using a mouse model that exploits a known risk factor for these disorders, maternal infection, we asked if the offspring of pregnant mice given a mid-gestation respiratory infection have cerebellar pathology resembling that seen in these disorders. We also tested the effects of maternal immune activation in the absence of virus by injection of the synthetic dsRNA, poly(I:C). We infected pregnant mice with influenza on embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5), or injected poly(I:C) i.p. on E12.5, and assessed the linear density of PCs in the cerebellum of adult or postnatal day 11 (P11) offspring. To study granule cell migration, we also injected BrdU on P11. Adult offspring of influenza- or poly(I:C)-exposed mice display a localized deficit in PCs in lobule VII of the cerebellum, as do P11 offspring. Coincident with this are heterotopic PCs, as well as delayed migration of granule cells in lobules VI and VII. The cerebellar pathology observed in the offspring of influenza- or poly(I:C)-exposed mice is strikingly similar to that observed in autism. The poly(I:C) findings indicate that deficits are likely caused by the activation of the maternal immune system. Finally, our data suggest that cerebellar abnormalities occur during embryonic development, and may be an early deficit in autism and schizophrenia.},

abstract = {The idea that there is some sort of abnormality in dopamine (DA) signalling is one of the more enduring hypotheses in schizophrenia research. Opinion leaders have published recent perspectives on the aetiology of this disorder with provocative titles such as 'Risk factors for schizophrenia--all roads lead to dopamine' or 'The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia--the final common pathway'. Perhaps, the other most enduring idea about schizophrenia is that it is a neurodevelopmental disorder. Those of us that model schizophrenia developmental risk-factor epidemiology in animals in an attempt to understand how this may translate to abnormal brain function have consistently shown that as adults these animals display behavioural, cognitive and pharmacological abnormalities consistent with aberrant DA signalling. The burning question remains how can in utero exposure to specific (environmental) insults induce persistent abnormalities in DA signalling in the adult? In this review, we summarize convergent evidence from two well-described developmental animal models, namely maternal immune activation and developmental vitamin D deficiency that begin to address this question. The adult offspring resulting from these two models consistently reveal locomotor abnormalities in response to DA-releasing or -blocking drugs. Additionally, as adults these animals have DA-related attentional and/or sensorimotor gating deficits. These findings are consistent with many other developmental animal models. However, the authors of this perspective have recently refocused their attention on very early aspects of DA ontogeny and describe reductions in genes that induce or specify dopaminergic phenotype in the embryonic brain and early changes in DA turnover suggesting that the origins of these behavioural abnormalities in adults may be traced to early alterations in DA ontogeny. Whether the convergent findings from these two models can be extended to other developmental animal models for this disease is at present unknown as such early brain alterations are rarely examined. Although it is premature to conclude that such mechanisms could be operating in other developmental animal models for schizophrenia, our convergent data have led us to propose that rather than all roads leading to DA, perhaps, this may be where they start.},

abstract = {Dysfunctional glutamatergic neurotransmission has been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, relatively few studies have directly measured brain glutamate in ASD adults, or related variation in glutamate to clinical phenotype. We therefore set out to investigate brain glutamate levels in adults with an ASD, comparing these to healthy controls and also comparing results between individuals at different points on the spectrum of symptom severity. We recruited 28 adults with ASD and 14 matched healthy controls. Of those with ASD, 15 fulfilled the 'narrowly' defined criteria for typical autism, whereas 13 met the 'broader phenotype'. We measured the concentration of the combined glutamate and glutamine signal (Glx), and other important metabolites, using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in two brain regions implicated in ASD--the basal ganglia (including the head of caudate and the anterior putamen) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex--as well as in a parietal cortex 'control' region. Individuals with ASD had a significant decrease (P<0.001) in concentration of Glx in the basal ganglia, and this was true in both the 'narrow' and 'broader' phenotype. Also, within the ASD sample, reduced basal ganglia Glx was significantly correlated with increased impairment in social communication (P=0.013). In addition, there was a significant reduction in the concentration of other metabolites such as choline, creatine (Cr) and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in the basal ganglia. In the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, Cr and NAA were reduced (P<0.05), although Glx was not. There were no detectable differences in Glx, or any other metabolite, in the parietal lobe control region. There were no significant between-group differences in age, gender, IQ, voxel composition or data quality. In conclusion, individuals across the spectrum of ASD have regionally specific abnormalities in subcortical glutamatergic neurotransmission that are associated with variation in social development.},

abstract = {• In the context of a Finnish birth cohort, we tested the hypothesis that viral infection during the latter two thirds of fetal development would increase the risk of adult schizophrenic outcome. Psychiatric hospital diagnoses were recorded for all individuals in greater Helsinki who were fetuses during the 1957 type A2 influenza epidemic. Those exposed to the viral epidemic during their second trimester of fetal development were at elevated risk of being admitted to a psychiatric hospital with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. This was true for both males and females and independently in several psychiatric hospitals. The second-trimester effect was seen in the elevated proportion of schizophrenics among those admitted to a psychiatric hospital and also in higher rates of schizophrenia per 1000 live births in the city of Helsinki. The study has several limitations: (1) We have no direct evidence that the subjects actually suffered a viral Infection. (2) The psychiatric data were obtained only for subjects up to the age of 26 years, 56 days. (3) The findings are based on hospital diagnoses. (4) The determination of stage of gestation at time of exposure to the epidemic is based on date of birth. The viral Infection might have occurred outside the official epidemic window; the infant may have had a preterm or postterm delivery. These sources of error, however, should not serve to enhance the findings. The observed viral effect is interpreted as being one of many potential perturbations of gestation. We suggest that It is less the type than the timing of the disturbance during fetal neural development that is critical in determining risk for schizophrenia.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Research is increasingly linking autism spectrum disorders and other neurodevelopmental disorders to synaptic abnormalities ("synaptopathies"). PSD-95 (postsynaptic density-95, DLG4) orchestrates protein-protein interactions at excitatory synapses and is a major functional bridge interconnecting a neurexinneuroligin-SHANK pathway implicated in autism spectrum disorders. METHOD: The authors characterized behavioral, dendritic, and molecular phenotypic abnormalities relevant to autism spectrum disorders in mice with PSD-95 deletion (Dlg4(-)(/)(-)). The data from mice led to the identification of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in human DLG4 and the examination of associations between these variants and neural signatures of Williams' syndrome in a normal population, using functional and structural neuroimaging. RESULTS: Dlg4(-)(/)(-) showed increased repetitive behaviors, abnormal communication and social behaviors, impaired motor coordination, and increased stress reactivity and anxiety-related responses. Dlg4(-)(/)(-) had subtle dysmorphology of amygdala dendritic spines and altered forebrain expression of various synaptic genes, including Cyln2, which regulates cytoskeletal dynamics and is a candidate gene for Williams' syndrome. A signifi-cant association was observed between variations in two human DLG4 SNPs and reduced intraparietal sulcus volume and abnormal cortico-amygdala coupling, both of which characterize Williams' syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that DLG4 gene disruption in mice produces a complex range of behavioral and molecular abnormalities relevant to autism spectrum disorders and Williams' syndrome. The study provides an initial link between human DLG4 gene variation and key neural endophenotypes of Williams' syndrome and perhaps corticoamygdala regulation of emotional and social processes more generally.},

@article{Meyer2005,
abstract = {Epidemiological studies have indicated an association between maternal bacterial and viral infections during pregnancy and the higher incidence of schizophrenia in the resultant offspring post-puberty. One hypothesis asserts that the reported epidemiological link is mediated by prenatal activation of the foetal immune system in response to the elevation of maternal cytokine level due to infection. Here, we report that pregnant mouse dams receiving a single exposure to the cytokine-releasing agent, polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid (PolyI:C; at 2.5, 5.0, or 10.0 mg/kg) on gestation day 9 produced offspring that subsequently exhibited multiple schizophrenia-related behavioural deficits in adulthood, in comparison to offspring from vehicle injected or non-injected control dams. The efficacy of the PolyI:C challenge to induce cytokine responses in naive non-pregnant adult female mice and in foetal brain tissue when injected to pregnant mice were further ascertained in separate subjects: (i) a dose-dependent elevation of interleukin-10 was detected in the adult female mice at 1 and 6h post-injection, (ii) 12 h following prenatal PolyI:C challenge, the foetal levels of interleukin-1beta were elevated. The spectrum of abnormalities included impairments in exploratory behaviour, prepulse inhibition, latent inhibition, the US-pre-exposure effect, spatial working memory; and enhancement in the locomotor response to systemic amphetamine (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) as well as in discrimination reversal learning. The neuropsychological parallels between prenatal PolyI:C treatment in mice and psychosis in humans, demonstrated here, leads us to conclude that prenatal PolyI:C treatment represents one of the most powerful environmental-developmental models of schizophrenia to date. The uniqueness of this model lies in its epidemiological and immunological relevance. It is, sui generis, ideally suited for the investigation of the neuropsychoimmunological mechanisms implicated in the developmental aetiology and disease processes of schizophrenia.},

@article{Waite2010,
abstract = {Our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the formation of the complex arrangement of neurons and their interconnections within the brain has made significant progress in recent years. Current research has uncovered a network of intracellular signaling events that provide precise coordination of a diverse array of cellular responses, including trafficking events, cytoskeletal remodeling, gene transcription, and protein ubiquitination and translation. This chapter considers the specific cellular responses controlled by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway, which is instructive with regard to a number of important steps involved in the development of the brain. These range from the mediation of extrinsic signals - such as growth factors, axon guidance cues, and extracellular matrix components - to intrinsic effectors, such as downstream signaling components that act, for example, at the translation level. PI3K signaling is, consequently, at the heart of controlling neuronal migration and neuronal morphogenesis, as well as dendrite and synapse development. Many neurobehavioral disorders arise as a consequence of subtle developmental abnormalities. Unsurprisingly, therefore, aberrant PI3K signaling has been indicated by many studies to be a contributing factor to the pathophysiology of disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. In this chapter, we will focus on the specific, yet divergent, cellular processes that are achieved through PI3K signaling in neurons and are key to brain development.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: The increasing availability of large network datasets along with the progresses in experimental high-throughput technologies have prompted the need for tools allowing easy integration of experimental data with data derived form network computational analysis. In order to enrich experimental data with network topological parameters, we have developed the Cytoscape plug-in CentiScaPe. The plug-in computes several network centrality parameters and allows the user to analyze existing relationships between experimental data provided by the users and node centrality values computed by the plug-in. CentiScaPe allows identifying network nodes that are relevant from both experimental and topological viewpoints. CentiScaPe also provides a Boolean logic-based tool that allows easy characterization of nodes whose topological relevance depends on more than one centrality. Finally, different graphic outputs and the included description of biological significance for each computed centrality facilitate the analysis by the end users not expert in graph theory, thus allowing easy node categorization and experimental prioritization. AVAILABILITY: CentiScaPe can be downloaded via the Cytoscape web site: http://chianti.ucsd.edu/cyto{\_}web/plugins/index.php.

abstract = {Conservation of the order in which events occur in developing mammalian brains permits use of regression theory to model the timing of neural development. Following a small adjustment to account for a systematic variability in primate cortical and limbic systems, the model is used to generate a 95-event/nine-species matrix that predicts aspects of neurogenesis and axonal outgrowth in the brains of developing mice, hamsters, rats, spiny mice, rabbits, ferrets, cats, monkeys, and humans. Although data are compiled from species in which the timing of birth and the rate of maturation vary widely, the model proves statistically accurate, with practical implications for improving estimation of milestones of neural development, particularly for humans. Using the three-factor model (species, neural events, and primate adjustments), we produce predictions for the timing of 493 neural occurrences in developing mammalian brains that either have not yet been, or cannot be, empirically derived. We also relate the timing of neural events across the nine species in the form of a reference table calibrated to the development of laboratory rats. This 'translation' table will assist in attempts to equate the neurodevelopmental literature across species with either large or small differences in gestation and maturation, and also permit studies done in a variety of mammals to be applied to better understand human development. The comparative data indicate that humans, although conventionally considered an altricial species, are neurally advanced at birth relative to the other species studied.},

We report that sex-dependent developmental structure changes exist in the C57Bl/6(J) mouse, a common model for the genetic analysis of brain function. High resolution, three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM) images were obtained in intact brains of male and female adult and peripubertal mice. The lateral and third ventricles, hippocampus, amygdala, striatum, and total brain were reconstructed in 3D. As observed in humans, there was overall cerebral growth from peripuberty to adulthood in both sexes. After correcting for the increased brain size, the hippocampus and amygdala were disproportionately larger in adult compared to peripubertal mice. Several sexual dimorphisms were also observed. The lateral ventricles were larger, while the amygdala (the left side in particular) was smaller in females compared to males. Lateral and third ventricles were reduced over time in males only, exhibiting a sex-specific developmental profile. The striatal size was uniform among the groups studied. The surface area of the segmented structures was assayed. Possible shape distortions were detected for the lateral ventricles, hippocampus, and overall brain structure based on a lack of covariance between the surface area and volumetric measurements. Although many sexually dimorphic changes are reported perinatally, our results suggest that there are additional sex-specific transformations that occur around puberty and persist in adulthood.},

abstract = {Using spike-in controls designed to mimic mammalian mRNA species, we used the quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to assess the performance of in vitro transcription (IVT) amplification process of small samples. We focused especially on the confidence of the transcript level measurement, which is essential for differential gene expression analyses. IVT reproduced gene expression profiles down to approximately 100 absolute input copies. However, a RT-qPCR analysis of the antisense RNA showed a systematic bias against low copy number transcripts, regardless of sequence. Experiments also showed that noise increases with decreasing copy number. First-round IVT preserved the gene expression information within a sample down to the 100 copy level, regardless of total input sample amount. However, the amplification was nonlinear under low total RNA input/long IVT conditions. Variability of the amplification increased predictably with decreasing input copy number. For the small enrichments of interest in typical differential gene expression studies (e.g., twofold changes), the bias from IVT reactions is unlikely to affect the results. In limited cases, some transcript-specific differential gene expression values will need adjustment to reflect this bias. Proper experimental design with reasonable detection limits will yield differential gene expression capability even between low copy number transcripts.},

abstract = {Recent breakthroughs in next-generation sequencing technologies allow cost-effective methods for measuring a growing list of cellular properties, including DNA sequence and structural variation. Next-generation sequencing has the potential to revolutionize complex trait genetics by directly measuring common and rare genetic variants within a genome-wide context. Because for a given gene both rare and common causal variants can coexist and have independent effects on a trait, strategies that model the effects of both common and rare variants could enhance the power of identifying disease-associated genes. To date, little work has been done on integrating signals from common and rare variants into powerful statistics for finding disease genes in genome-wide association studies. In this analysis of the Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 data, we evaluate various strategies for association of rare, common, or a combination of both rare and common variants on quantitative phenotypes in unrelated individuals. We show that the analysis of common variants only using classical approaches can achieve higher power to detect causal genes than recently proposed rare variant methods and that strategies that combine association signals derived independently in rare and common variants can slightly increase the power compared to strategies that focus on the effect of either the rare variants or the common variants.},

abstract = {The enormous complexity of the human brain ultimately derives from a finite set of molecular instructions encoded in the human genome. These instructions can be directly studied by exploring the organization of the brain's transcriptome through systematic analysis of gene coexpression relationships. We analyzed gene coexpression relationships in microarray data generated from specific human brain regions and identified modules of coexpressed genes that correspond to neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia. These modules provide an initial description of the transcriptional programs that distinguish the major cell classes of the human brain and indicate that cell type-specific information can be obtained from whole brain tissue without isolating homogeneous populations of cells. Other modules corresponded to additional cell types, organelles, synaptic function, gender differences and the subventricular neurogenic niche. We found that subventricular zone astrocytes, which are thought to function as neural stem cells in adults, have a distinct gene expression pattern relative to protoplasmic astrocytes. Our findings provide a new foundation for neurogenetic inquiries by revealing a robust and previously unrecognized organization to the human brain transcriptome.},

abstract = {Cytokines have been recognized to play an important role both in normal development of the brain, when they act as neurotrophic factors, as well as following injury. While both the cytokines and their receptors are synthesized and expressed in the brain normally (albeit at low levels), it has become clear that elevated levels are associated with many neurological disorders. In this review, we have chosen to present the data for only a few of the cytokines, including interleukin-1beta, interleukin-3, interleukin-6, interferon-gamma, transforming growth factor-beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Data are presented that suggest roles they may play in human disorders, including stroke, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and several psychiatric disorders. The results in human disease are compared with results obtained in a variety of transgenic animal models. The mouse models have very different disorders depending on whether a cytokine is overexpressed either peripherally or in either astrocytes or neurons. The potential significance of this to the understanding of human disease is discussed.},

abstract = {An emerging literature from epidemiologic, clinical, and preclinical investigations has provided evidence that gestational exposure to infection contributes to the etiology of schizophrenia. In recent years, these studies have moved from ecologic designs, which ascertain infection based on epidemics in populations, to investigations that have capitalized on reliable biomarkers in individual pregnancies. These studies have documented specific candidate infections that appear to be associated with an elevated risk of schizophrenia. Animal models of maternal immune activation inspired by this work have revealed intriguing findings indicating behavioral, neurochemical, and neurophysiologic abnormalities consistent with observations in schizophrenia. In parallel studies in humans and animals, investigators are working to uncover the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which in utero exposure to infection contributes to schizophrenia risk. In this review, the authors discuss and critically evaluate the epidemiologic literature on in utero exposure to infection and schizophrenia, summarize emerging animal models of maternal immune activation, and discuss putative unique and common mechanisms by which in utero exposure to infection alters neurodevelopment, potentially increasing susceptibility to schizophrenia. The promise of this work for facilitating the identification of susceptibility loci in genetic studies of schizophrenia is illustrated by examples of interaction between in utero exposure to infection and genetic variants. The authors then elaborate on possible implications of this work, including the use of preventive measures for reducing the incidence of schizophrenia. Finally, they discuss new approaches aimed at addressing current challenges in this area of research.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Equally important and challenging as genome annotation, is the subsequent classification of predicted genes into their respective pathways. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) represents a database consisting of known genes and their respective biochemical functionalities. Although accessible online, analyses of multiple genes are time consuming and are not suitable for analyzing data sets that are proprietary. RESULTS: Presented here is a new software solution that utilizes the KEGG online database for pathway mapping of partial and whole prokaryotic genomes. PathwayVoyager retrieves user-defined subsets of the KEGG database and stores the data as local, blast-formatted databases. Previously selected datasets can be re-used, reducing run-time significantly. Whole or partial genomes can be automatically analyzed using NCBI's BlastP algorithm and ORFs with similarities below the user-defined threshold will be marked on pathway maps. Multiple gene hits are sorted by similarity. Since no sequence information is transmitted over the Internet, PathwayVoyager is an ideal solution for pathway mapping and reconstruction of confidential DNA sequence data. CONCLUSION: PathwayVoyager represents an alternative approach to many already existing, more complex pathway reconstructions software solutions. This software does not require any dedicated hardware or software and is flexible and straightforward to use. It is ideally suited for environments where analyses on variable datasets are desired.},

abstract = {Several epidemiological studies have shown an association between infection or inflammation during pregnancy and increased risk of autism in the child. In addition, animal models have illustrated that maternal inflammation during gestation can cause autism-relevant behaviors in the offspring; so called maternal immune activation (MIA) models. More recently, permanent changes in T cell cytokine responses were reported in children with autism and in offspring of MIA mice; however, the cytokine responses of other immune cell populations have not been thoroughly investigated in these MIA models. Similar to changes in T cell function, we hypothesized that following MIA, offspring will have long-term changes in macrophage function. To test this theory, we utilized the poly (I:C) MIA mouse model in C57BL/6J mice and examined macrophage cytokine production in adult offspring. Pregnant dams were given either a single injection of 20mg/kg polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, poly (I:C), or saline delivered intraperitoneally on gestational day 12.5. When offspring of poly (I:C) treated dams reached 10weeks of age, femurs were collected and bone marrow-derived macrophages were generated. Cytokine production was measured in bone marrow-derived macrophages incubated for 24h in either growth media alone, LPS, IL-4/LPS, or IFN-gamma/LPS. Following stimulation with LPS alone, or the combination of IFN-gamma/LPS, macrophages from offspring of poly (I:C) treated dams produced higher levels of IL-12(p40) (p<0.04) suggesting an increased M1 polarization. In addition, even without the presence of a polarizing cytokine or LPS stimulus, macrophages from offspring of poly (I:C) treated dams exhibited a higher production of CCL3 (p=0.05). Moreover, CCL3 levels were further increased when stimulated with LPS, or polarized with either IL-4/LPS or IFN-gamma/LPS (p<0.05) suggesting a general increase in production of this chemokine. Collectively, these data suggest that MIA can produce lasting changes in macrophage function that are sustained into adulthood.},

abstract = {Protein kinase B (AKT) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3beta) are two protein kinases involved in dopaminergic signaling. Dopamine-associated neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder seem to be characterized by impairments in the AKT/GSK3beta network. Here, we sought evidence for the presence of molecular and functional changes in the AKT/GSK3beta pathway using an established infection-based mouse model of developmental neuropsychiatric disease that is based on prenatal administration of the viral mimetic poly(I:C) (=polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid). We found that adult offspring of poly(I:C)-exposed mothers displayed decreased total levels of AKT protein and reduced phosphorylation at AKT threonine residues in the medial prefrontal cortex. Prenatally immune challenged offspring also exhibited increased GSK3beta protein expression and activation status, the latter of which was evidenced by a decrease in the ratio between phosphorylated and total GSK3beta protein in the medial prefrontal cortex. These molecular changes were not associated with overt signs of inflammatory processes in the adult brain. We further found that acute pre-treatment with the selective GSK3beta inhibitor TDZD-8 dose-dependently normalized aberrant behavior typically emerging following prenatal immune activation, including deficient spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze and increased locomotor responses to systemic amphetamine treatment. Taken together, the present mouse model demonstrates that prenatal exposure to viral-like immune activation leads to long-term alterations in GSK3beta signaling, some of which are critically implicated in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A limited number of reports have demonstrated abnormalities involving the glutamate and gamma amino butyric acid systems in blood and platelets of subjects with autism. To further investigate these studies, brain levels of rate limiting enzyme, glutamic acid decarboxylase, which is responsible for normal conversion of glutamate to gamma amino butyric acid in the brain, were investigated. METHODS: Postmortem cerebellar and parietal cortices of age (mean +/- SD for controls 23 +/- 4.2, autistic 25.2 +/- 5.2 cerebellum; controls 23.5 +/- 4.8, autistic 21.6 +/- 3.8 parietal cortex), gender and postmortem interval-matched autistic and control subjects (n = 8 control, n = 5 autism, cerebellum; n = 4 control, n = 5 autism, parietal cortex) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blotting. Brain levels of glutamic acid decarboxylase proteins of 65 and 67 kDa and beta-actin were determined. RESULTS: Glutamic acid decarboxylase protein of 65 kDa was reduced by 48{\%} and 50{\%} in parietal and cerebellar (p <.02) areas of autistic brains versus controls respectively. By the same token, glutamic acid decarboxylase protein of 67 kDa was reduced by 61{\%} and 51{\%} in parietal (p <.03) and cerebellar areas of autistic brains versus controls respectively. Brain levels of beta-actin were essentially similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The observed reductions in glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 and 67 kDa levels may account for reported increases of glutamate in blood and platelets of autistic subjects. Glutamic acid decarboxylase deficiency may be due to or associated with abnormalities in levels of glutamate/gamma amino butyric acid, or transporter/receptor density in autistic brain.},

abstract = {Inherited alleles account for most of the genetic risk for schizophrenia. However, new (de novo) mutations, in the form of large chromosomal copy number changes, occur in a small fraction of cases and disproportionally disrupt genes encoding postsynaptic proteins. Here we show that small de novo mutations, affecting one or a few nucleotides, are overrepresented among glutamatergic postsynaptic proteins comprising activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (ARC) and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) complexes. Mutations are additionally enriched in proteins that interact with these complexes to modulate synaptic strength, namely proteins regulating actin filament dynamics and those whose messenger RNAs are targets of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Genes affected by mutations in schizophrenia overlap those mutated in autism and intellectual disability, as do mutation-enriched synaptic pathways. Aligning our findings with a parallel case-control study, we demonstrate reproducible insights into aetiological mechanisms for schizophrenia and reveal pathophysiology shared with other neurodevelopmental disorders.},

abstract = {Previous [3H]thymidine studies in Nissl-stained sections in rats established that the substantia nigra pars compacta and the ventral tegmental area originate sequentially according to an anterolateral to posteromedial neurogenetic gradient. We investigated whether that same pattern is found in mice in the dopaminergic neurons in each of these structures. Using tyrosine hydroxylase immunostaining combined with [3H]thymidine autoradiography, the time of origin of dopaminergic midbrain neurons in the retrorubral field, the substantia nigra pars compacta, the ventral tegmental area, and the interfascicular nucleus was determined in postnatal day 20 mice. The dams of the experimental animals were injected with [3H]thymidine on embryonic days (E) 11-E12, E12-E13, E13-E14, and E14-E15. The time of origin profiles for each group indicated significant differences between populations. The retrorubral field and the substantia nigra pars compacta arose nearly simultaneously and contained the highest proportion of neurons, 49 to 37{\%}, generated on or before E11. Progressively fewer early-generated neurons were found in the ventral tegmental area (20{\%}), and the interfascicular nucleus (8.5{\%}). In addition, anterior dorsolateral neurons in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area were more likely to be generated early than the posterior ventromedial neurons. These findings indicate that mouse and rat brains have nearly identical developmental patterns in the midbrain, and neurogenetic gradients in dopaminergic neurons are similar to those found in Nissl studies in rats.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The pathophysiological characteristics of schizophrenia appear to involve altered synaptic connectivity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Given the central role that layer 3 pyramidal neurons play in corticocortical and thalamocortical connectivity, we hypothesized that the excitatory inputs to these neurons are altered in subjects with schizophrenia. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we determined the density of dendritic spines, markers of excitatory inputs, on the basilar dendrites of Golgi-impregnated pyramidal neurons in the superficial and deep portions of layer 3 in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (area 46) and in layer 3 of the primary visual cortex (area 17) of 15 schizophrenic subjects, 15 normal control subjects, and 15 nonschizophrenic subjects with a psychiatric illness (referred to as psychiatric subjects). RESULTS: There was a significant effect of diagnosis on spine density only for deep layer 3 pyramidal neurons in area 46 (P = .006). In the schizophrenic subjects, spine density on these neurons was decreased by 23{\%} and 16{\%} compared with the normal control (P = .004) and psychiatric (P = .08) subjects, respectively. In contrast, spine density on neurons in superficial layer 3 in area 46 (P = .09) or in area 17 (P = .08) did not significantly differ across the 3 subject groups. Furthermore, spine density on deep layer 3 neurons in area 46 did not significantly (P = .81) differ between psychiatric subjects treated with antipsychotic agents and normal controls. CONCLUSION: This region- and disease-specific decrease in dendritic spine density on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex layer 3 pyramidal cells is consistent with the hypothesis that the number of cortical and/or thalamic excitatory inputs to these neurons is altered in subjects with schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Exome sequencing of 343 families, each with a single child on the autism spectrum and at least one unaffected sibling, reveal de novo small indels and point substitutions, which come mostly from the paternal line in an age-dependent manner. We do not see significantly greater numbers of de novo missense mutations in affected versus unaffected children, but gene-disrupting mutations (nonsense, splice site, and frame shifts) are twice as frequent, 59 to 28. Based on this differential and the number of recurrent and total targets of gene disruption found in our and similar studies, we estimate between 350 and 400 autism susceptibility genes. Many of the disrupted genes in these studies are associated with the fragile X protein, FMRP, reinforcing links between autism and synaptic plasticity. We find FMRP-associated genes are under greater purifying selection than the remainder of genes and suggest they are especially dosage-sensitive targets of cognitive disorders.},

abstract = {De novo assembly of RNA-seq data enables researchers to study transcriptomes without the need for a genome sequence; this approach can be usefully applied, for instance, in research on 'non-model organisms' of ecological and evolutionary importance, cancer samples or the microbiome. In this protocol we describe the use of the Trinity platform for de novo transcriptome assembly from RNA-seq data in non-model organisms. We also present Trinity-supported companion utilities for downstream applications, including RSEM for transcript abundance estimation, R/Bioconductor packages for identifying differentially expressed transcripts across samples and approaches to identify protein-coding genes. In the procedure, we provide a workflow for genome-independent transcriptome analysis leveraging the Trinity platform. The software, documentation and demonstrations are freely available from http://trinityrnaseq.sourceforge.net. The run time of this protocol is highly dependent on the size and complexity of data to be analyzed. The example data set analyzed in the procedure detailed herein can be processed in less than 5 h.},

abstract = {A number of studies in recent years have shown that members of the Roundabout (Robo) receptor family, Robo1 and Robo2, play significant roles in the formation of axonal tracks in the developing forebrain and in the migration and morphological differentiation of cortical interneurons. Here, we investigated the expression and function of Robo3 in the developing cortex. We found that this receptor is strongly expressed in the preplate layer and cortical hem of the early cortex where it colocalizes with markers of Cajal-Retzius cells and interneurons. Analysis of Robo3 mutant mice at early (embryonic day [E] 13.5) and late (E18.5) stages of corticogenesis revealed no significant change in the number of interneurons, but a change in their morphology at E13.5. However, preliminary analysis on a small number of mice that lacked all 3 Robo receptors indicated a marked reduction in the number of cortical interneurons, but only a limited effect on their morphology. These observations and the results of other recent studies suggest a complex interplay between the 3 Robo receptors in regulating the number, migration and morphological differentiation of cortical interneurons.},

abstract = {Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been associated with adverse developmental outcome, including intra-uterine fetal death (IUFD), intra-uterine growth retardation (IUGR) and neurological injury. In the LPS model, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is the major mediator leading to IUFD, IUGR and neurological injury. In the present study, we investigated the effect of maternally-administered LPS on TNF-alpha in maternal serum, amniotic fluid, fetal liver and fetal brain. The timed pregnant mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with a single dose of LPS (500microg/kg) on gestational day 17. As expected, TNF-alpha was obviously increased in maternal serum and amniotic fluid in response to LPS. Although maternally-administered LPS also increased the level of TNF-alpha protein in fetal liver and brain, no significant difference in TNF-alpha mRNA level in fetal liver and brain was observed among different groups, suggesting that the increased TNF-alpha protein in fetal liver and brain may be transferred from either the maternal circulation or amniotic fluid or placenta. When the pregnant mice were pretreated with a low-dose LPS (10microg/kg, i.p.) at 4, 12, 24 or 48h before LPS (500microg/kg, i.p.), LPS-evoked TNF-alpha in maternal serum and amniotic fluid was significantly inhibited. Importantly, low-dose LPS pretreatment also greatly attenuated LPS-induced increases in TNF-alpha protein in fetal liver and fetal brain. Taken together, these results indicate that perinatal exposure to low-dose LPS induces a reduced sensitivity to subsequent LPS challenge.},

@article{Hsiao2011,
abstract = {Activation of the maternal immune system in rodent models sets in motion a cascade of molecular pathways that ultimately result in autism- and schizophrenia-related behaviors in offspring. The finding that interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a crucial mediator of these effects led us to examine the mechanism by which this cytokine influences fetal development in vivo. Here we focus on the placenta as the site of direct interaction between mother and fetus and as a principal modulator of fetal development. We find that maternal immune activation (MIA) with a viral mimic, synthetic double-stranded RNA (poly(I:C)), increases IL-6 mRNA as well as maternally-derived IL-6 protein in the placenta. Placentas from MIA mothers exhibit increases in CD69+ decidual macrophages, granulocytes and uterine NK cells, indicating elevated early immune activation. Maternally-derived IL-6 mediates activation of the JAK/STAT3 pathway specifically in the spongiotrophoblast layer of the placenta, which results in expression of acute phase genes. Importantly, this parallels an IL-6-dependent disruption of the growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor (GH-IGF) axis that is characterized by decreased GH, IGFI and IGFBP3 levels. In addition, we observe an IL-6-dependent induction in pro-lactin-like protein-K (PLP-K) expression as well as MIA-related alterations in other placental endocrine factors. Together, these IL-6-mediated effects of MIA on the placenta represent an indirect mechanism by which MIA can alter fetal development.},

Over the past four years MINT has undergone extensive revision. The new version of MINT is based on a completely remodeled database structure, which offers more efficient data exploration and analysis, and is characterized by entries with a richer annotation. Over the past few years the number of curated physical interactions has soared to over 95 000. The whole dataset can be freely accessed online in both interactive and batch modes through web-based interfaces and an FTP server.

abstract = {Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most widespread form of dementia during the later stages of life. If improved therapeutics are not developed, the prevalence of AD will drastically increase in the coming years as the world's population ages. By identifying differences in neuronal gene expression profiles between healthy elderly persons and individuals diagnosed with AD, we may be able to better understand the molecular mechanisms that drive AD pathogenesis, including the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. In this study, we expression profiled histopathologically normal cortical neurons collected with laser capture microdissection (LCM) from six anatomically and functionally discrete postmortem brain regions in 34 AD-afflicted individuals, using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays. These regions include the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, middle temporal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex, superior frontal gyrus, and primary visual cortex. This study is predicated on previous parallel research on the postmortem brains of the same six regions in 14 healthy elderly individuals, for which LCM neurons were similarly processed for expression analysis. We identified significant regional differential expression in AD brains compared with control brains including expression changes of genes previously implicated in AD pathogenesis, particularly with regard to tangle and plaque formation. Pinpointing the expression of factors that may play a role in AD pathogenesis provides a foundation for future identification of new targets for improved AD therapeutics. We provide this carefully phenotyped, laser capture microdissected intraindividual brain region expression data set to the community as a public resource.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that severe adverse life events during pregnancy increase the risk of schizophrenia in the offspring. The serotonin 5-HT(2A) and the metabotropic glutamate 2 (mGlu2) receptors both have been the target of considerable attention regarding schizophrenia and antipsychotic drug development. We tested the effects of maternal variable stress during pregnancy on expression and behavioral function of these two receptors in mice. Prenatal stress increased 5-HT(2A) and decreased mGlu2 expression in frontal cortex, a brain region involved in perception, cognition, and mood. This pattern of expression of 5-HT(2A) and mGlu2 receptors was consistent with behavioral alterations, including increased head-twitch response to the hallucinogenic 5-HT(2A) agonist DOI [1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane] and decreased mGlu2-dependent antipsychotic-like effect of the mGlu2/3 agonist LY379268 (1R,4R,5S,6R-2-oxa-4-aminobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-4,6-dicarboxylate) in adult, but not prepubertal, mice born to stressed mothers during pregnancy. Cross-fostering studies determined that these alterations were not attributable to effects of prenatal stress on maternal care. Additionally, a similar pattern of biochemical and behavioral changes were observed in mice born to mothers injected with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] during pregnancy as a model of prenatal immune activation. These data strengthen pathophysiological hypotheses that propose an early neurodevelopmental origin for schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia and autism are thought to result from the interaction between a susceptibility genotype and environmental risk factors. The offspring of women who experience infection while pregnant have an increased risk for these disorders. Maternal immune activation (MIA) in pregnant rodents produces offspring with abnormalities in behavior, histology, and gene expression that are reminiscent of schizophrenia and autism, making MIA a useful model of the disorders. However, the mechanism by which MIA causes long-term behavioral deficits in the offspring is unknown. Here we show that the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) is critical for mediating the behavioral and transcriptional changes in the offspring. A single maternal injection of IL-6 on day 12.5 of mouse pregnancy causes prepulse inhibition (PPI) and latent inhibition (LI) deficits in the adult offspring. Moreover, coadministration of an anti-IL-6 antibody in the poly(I:C) model of MIA prevents the PPI, LI, and exploratory and social deficits caused by poly(I:C) and normalizes the associated changes in gene expression in the brains of adult offspring. Finally, MIA in IL-6 knock-out mice does not result in several of the behavioral changes seen in the offspring of wild-type mice after MIA. The identification of IL-6 as a key intermediary should aid in the molecular dissection of the pathways whereby MIA alters fetal brain development, which can shed new light on the pathophysiological mechanisms that predispose to schizophrenia and autism.},

abstract = {A defect in neurotransmission involving gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) in schizophrenia was first proposed in the early 1970s. Since that time, a considerable effort has been made to find such a defect in components of the GABAergic system. After a brief introduction focusing on historical perspectives, this paper reviews post-mortem and other biological studies examining the following components of the GABAergic system in schizophrenic subjects: the GABA biosynthetic enzyme, glutamate decarboxylase; free GABA; the GABA transporter; the GABAA, GABAB and benzodiazepine receptors; and the catabolic enzyme GABA transaminase. Additionally, post-mortem studies using morphology or calcium-binding protein to identify GABAergic neurons are also reviewed. Substantial evidence argues for a defect in the GABAergic system of the frontal cortex in schizophrenia which is limited to the parvalbumin-class of GABAergic interneurons.},

abstract = {22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) frequently accompanies psychiatric conditions, some of which are classified as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in the current diagnostic categorization. However, it remains elusive how the chromosomal microdeletion leads to the mental manifestation at the mechanistic level. Here we show that a 22q11DS mouse model with a deletion of 18 orthologous genes of human 22q11 (Df1/+ mice) has deficits in migration of cortical interneurons and hippocampal dentate precursor cells. Furthermore, Df1/+ mice show functional defects in Chemokine receptor 4/Chemokine ligand 12 (Cxcr4/Cxcl12; Sdf1) signaling, which reportedly underlie interneuron migration. Notably, the defects in interneuron progenitors are rescued by ectopic expression of Dgcr8, one of the genes in 22q11 microdeletion. Furthermore, heterozygous knockout mice for Dgcr8 show similar neurodevelopmental abnormalities as Df1/+ mice. Thus, Dgcr8-mediated regulation of microRNA is likely to underlie Cxcr4/Cxcl12 signaling and associated neurodevelopmental defects. Finally, we observe that expression of CXCL12 is decreased in olfactory neurons from sporadic cases with schizophrenia compared with normal controls. Given the increased risk of 22q11DS in schizophrenia that frequently shows interneuron abnormalities, the overall study suggests that CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling may represent a common downstream mediator in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and related mental conditions.},

Although applicable to any system of molecular components and interactions, Cytoscape is most powerful when used in conjunction with large databases of protein-protein, protein-DNA, and genetic interactions that are increasingly available for humans and model organisms. Cytoscape's software Core provides basic functionality to layout and query the network; to visually integrate the network with expression profiles, phenotypes, and other molecular states; and to link the network to databases of functional annotations. The Core is extensible through a straightforward plug-in architecture, allowing rapid development of additional computational analyses and features. Several case studies of Cytoscape plug-ins are surveyed, including a search for interaction pathways correlating with changes in gene expression, a study of protein complexes involved in cellular recovery to DNA damage, inference of a combined physical/functional interaction network for Halobacterium, and an interface to detailed stochastic/kinetic gene regulatory models.},

abstract = {Recent findings indicate that neurons are not merely passive targets of microglia but rather control microglial activity. The variety of different signals that neurons use to control microglia can be divided into two categories: 'Off' signals constitutively keep microglia in their resting state and antagonize proinflammatory activity. 'On' signals are inducible and include purines, chemokines, glutamate. They instruct microglia activation under pathological conditions towards a beneficial or detrimental phenotype. Various neuronal signaling molecules thus actively control microglia function, thereby contribute to the inflammatory milieu of the central nervous system. Thus, neurons should be envisaged as key immune modulators in the brain.},

abstract = {Corticosteroid hormones are released in high amounts after stress. The hormones enter the brain compartment and bind to high affinity mineralocorticoid receptors--particularly enriched in limbic regions--as well as to lower affinity glucocorticoid receptors which are more ubiquitous. Shortly after the stressful event, corticosteroids (in concert with specific monoamines and neuropeptides) have the potential to increase cellular excitability in subfields of the hippocampus, like the CA1 area. These effects are rapid in onset and occur via a nongenomic pathway. At the same time, however, the hormones also start slower, gene-mediated processes. These cause attenuation of excitatory information flow through the CA1 hippocampal area. Induction of long-term potentiation at that time is impaired. This may help to normalize hippocampal activity some hours after the stressful event and preserve information encoded within the context of the event. These adaptational effects of the hormones may become maladaptive if the stressful event is associated with other challenges of the network (like ischemic insults) or when stress occurs repetitively, in an uncontrollable and unpredictable manner. In that case, i) normalization of activity seems to be less efficient (particularly when other limbic areas like the amygdala nuclei are activated during stress), ii) induction of long-term potentiation is hampered at all times and iii) serotonin responses are attenuated. This may contribute to the precipitation of clinical symptoms in stress-related disorders such as major depression. A better understanding of the corticosteroid actions could lead to a more rational treatment strategy of stress-related disorders.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Some, but not all, previous studies suggest that prenatal influenza exposure increases the risk of schizophrenia. These studies used dates of influenza epidemics and maternal recall of infection to define influenza exposure, suggesting that discrepant findings may have resulted from exposure misclassification. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether serologically documented prenatal exposure to influenza increases the risk of schizophrenia. DESIGN: Nested case-control study of a large birth cohort, born from 1959 through 1966, and followed up for psychiatric disorders 30 to 38 years later. SETTING: Population-based birth cohort. PARTICIPANTS: Cases were 64 birth cohort members diagnosed as having schizophrenia spectrum disorders (mostly schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder). Controls were 125 members of the birth cohort, had not been diagnosed as having a schizophrenia spectrum or major affective disorder, and were matched to cases on date of birth, sex, length of time in the cohort, and availability of maternal serum. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Archived maternal serum was assayed for influenza antibody in pregnancies giving rise to offspring with schizophrenia and matched control offspring. RESULTS: The risk of schizophrenia was increased 7-fold for influenza exposure during the first trimester. There was no increased risk of schizophrenia with influenza during the second or third trimester. With the use of a broader gestational period of influenza exposure-early to midpregnancy-the risk of schizophrenia was increased 3-fold. The findings persisted after adjustment for potential confounders. CONCLUSIONS: These findings represent the first serologic evidence that prenatal influenza plays a role in schizophrenia. If confirmed, the results may have implications for the prevention of schizophrenia and for unraveling pathogenic mechanisms of the disorder.},

abstract = {Maternal viral infection is known to increase the risk for schizophrenia and autism in the offspring. Using this observation in an animal model, we find that respiratory infection of pregnant mice (both BALB/c and C57BL/6 strains) with the human influenza virus yields offspring that display highly abnormal behavioral responses as adults. As in schizophrenia and autism, these offspring display deficits in prepulse inhibition (PPI) in the acoustic startle response. Compared with control mice, the infected mice also display striking responses to the acute administration of antipsychotic (clozapine and chlorpromazine) and psychomimetic (ketamine) drugs. Moreover, these mice are deficient in exploratory behavior in both open-field and novel-object tests, and they are deficient in social interaction. At least some of these behavioral changes likely are attributable to the maternal immune response itself. That is, maternal injection of the synthetic double-stranded RNA polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid causes a PPI deficit in the offspring in the absence of virus. Therefore, maternal viral infection has a profound effect on the behavior of adult offspring, probably via an effect of the maternal immune response on the fetus.},

abstract = {Kv2.1 is a potassium channel alpha-subunit abundantly expressed throughout the brain. It is a main component of delayed rectifier current (I(K)) in several neuronal types and a regulator of excitability during high-frequency firing. Here we identify AMIGO (amphoterin-induced gene and ORF), a neuronal adhesion protein with leucine-rich repeat and immunoglobin domains, as an integral part of the Kv2.1 channel complex. AMIGO shows extensive spatial and temporal colocalization and association with Kv2.1 in the mouse brain. The colocalization of AMIGO and Kv2.1 is retained even during stimulus-induced changes in Kv2.1 localization. AMIGO increases Kv2.1 conductance in a voltage-dependent manner in HEK cells. Accordingly, inhibition of endogenous AMIGO suppresses neuronal I(K) at negative membrane voltages. In conclusion, our data indicate AMIGO as a function-modulating auxiliary subunit for Kv2.1 and thus provide new insights into regulation of neuronal excitability.},

abstract = {The reelin gene encodes an extracellular protein that is crucial for neuronal migration in laminated brain regions. To gain insights into the functions of Reelin, we performed high-resolution in situ hybridization analyses to determine the pattern of reelin expression in the developing forebrain of the mouse. We also performed double-labeling studies with several markers, including calcium-binding proteins, GAD65/67, and neuropeptides, to characterize the neuronal subsets that express reelin transcripts. reelin expression was detected at embryonic day 10 and later in the forebrain, with a distribution that is consistent with the prosomeric model of forebrain regionalization. In the diencephalon, expression was restricted to transverse and longitudinal domains that delineated boundaries between neuromeres. During embryogenesis, reelin was detected in the cerebral cortex in Cajal-Retzius cells but not in the GABAergic neurons of layer I. At prenatal stages, reelin was also expressed in the olfactory bulb, and striatum and in restricted nuclei in the ventral telencephalon, hypothalamus, thalamus, and pretectum. At postnatal stages, reelin transcripts gradually disappeared from Cajal-Retzius cells, at the same time as they appeared in subsets of GABAergic neurons distributed throughout neocortical and hippocampal layers. In other telencephalic and diencephalic regions, reelin expression decreased steadily during the postnatal period. In the adult, there was prominent expression in the olfactory bulb and cerebral cortex, where it was restricted to subsets of GABAergic interneurons that co-expressed calbindin, calretinin, neuropeptide Y, and somatostatin. This complex pattern of cellular and regional expression is consistent with Reelin having multiple roles in brain development and adult brain function.},

Some of the proteoglycans have distinct core protein structures, and others display similarities and thus may be grouped into families such as the syndecans, the glypicans, or the hyalectans (or lecticans). Proteoglycans can be found in almost all tissues being present in the extracellular matrix, on cellular surfaces, or in intracellular granules. In recent years, brain proteoglycans have attracted growing interest due to their highly regulated spatiotemporal expression during nervous system development and maturation. There is increasing evidence that different proteoglycans act as regulators of cell migration, axonal pathfinding, synaptogenesis, and structural plasticity. This review summarizes the most recent data on structures and functions of brain proteoglycans and focuses on new physiological concepts for their potential roles in the developing central nervous system.},

abstract = {FMRP loss of function causes Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and autistic features. FMRP is a polyribosome-associated neuronal RNA-binding protein, suggesting that it plays a key role in regulating neuronal translation, but there has been little consensus regarding either its RNA targets or mechanism of action. Here, we use high-throughput sequencing of RNAs isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) to identify FMRP interactions with mouse brain polyribosomal mRNAs. FMRP interacts with the coding region of transcripts encoding pre- and postsynaptic proteins and transcripts implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We developed a brain polyribosome-programmed translation system, revealing that FMRP reversibly stalls ribosomes specifically on its target mRNAs. Our results suggest that loss of a translational brake on the synthesis of a subset of synaptic proteins contributes to FXS. In addition, they provide insight into the molecular basis of the cognitive and allied defects in FXS and ASD and suggest multiple targets for clinical intervention.},

abstract = {Maternal infection during pregnancy increases the risk for neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia and autism in the offspring. This association appears to be critically dependent on the precise prenatal timing. However, the extent to which distinct adult psychopathological and neuropathological traits may be sensitive to the precise times of prenatal immune activation remains to be further characterized. Here, we evaluated in a mouse model of prenatal immune challenge by the viral mimic, polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid (PolyIC), whether prenatal immune activation in early/middle and late gestation may influence the susceptibility to some of the critical cognitive, pharmacological, and neuroanatomical dysfunctions implicated in schizophrenia and autism. We revealed that PolyIC-induced prenatal immune challenge on gestation day (GD) 9 but not GD17 significantly impaired sensorimotor gating and reduced prefrontal dopamine D1 receptors in adulthood, whereas prenatal immune activation specifically in late gestation impaired working memory, potentiated the locomotor reaction to the NMDA-receptor antagonist dizocilpine, and reduced hippocampal NMDA-receptor subunit 1 expression. On the other hand, potentiation of the locomotor reaction to the dopamine-receptor agonist amphetamine and reduction in Reelin- and Parvalbumin-expressing prefrontal neurons emerged independently of the precise times of prenatal immune challenge. Our findings thus highlight that prenatal immune challenge during early/middle and late fetal development in mice leads to distinct brain and behavioral pathological symptom clusters in adulthood. Further examination and evaluation of in utero immune challenge at different times of gestation may provide important new insight into the neuroimmunological and neuropathological mechanisms underlying the segregation of different symptom clusters in heterogeneous neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and autism.},

abstract = {Gene*environment interactions play critical roles in the emergence of autism and schizophrenia pathophysiology. In both disorders, recent genetic association studies have provided evidence for disease-linked variation in immune system genes and postmortem gene expression studies have shown extensive chronic immune abnormalities in brains of diseased subjects. Furthermore, peripheral biomarker studies revealed that both innate and adaptive immune systems are dysregulated. In both disorders symptoms of the disease correlate with the immune system dysfunction; yet, in autism this process appears to be chronic and sustained, while in schizophrenia it is exacerbated during acute episodes. Furthermore, since immune abnormalities endure into adulthood and anti-inflammatory agents appear to be beneficial, it is likely that these immune changes actively contribute to disease symptoms. Modeling these changes in animals provided further evidence that prenatal maternal immune activation alters neurodevelopment and leads to behavioral changes that are relevant for autism and schizophrenia. The converging evidence strongly argues that neurodevelopmental immune insults and genetic background critically interact and result in increased risk for either autism or schizophrenia. Further research in these areas may improve prenatal health screening in genetically at-risk families and may also lead to new preventive and/or therapeutic strategies.},

abstract = {Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a devastating neurological disorder that is caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene. Mecp2-mutant mice have been used as a model system to study the disease mechanism. Our previous work has suggested that MeCP2 malfunction in neurons is the primary cause of RTT in the mouse. However, the neurophysiological consequences of MeCP2 malfunction remain obscure. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in cortical slices, we show that spontaneous activity of pyramidal neurons is reduced in Mecp2-mutant mice. This decrease is not caused by a change in the intrinsic properties of the recorded neurons. Instead, the balance between cortical excitation and inhibition is shifted to favor inhibition over excitation. Moreover, analysis of the miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs)/inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in the Mecp2-mutant cortex reveals a reduction in mEPSC amplitudes, without significant change in the average mIPSC amplitude or frequency. These findings provide the first detailed electrophysiological analysis of Mecp2-mutant mice and provide a framework for understanding the pathophysiology of the disease and tools for studying the underlying disease mechanisms.},

abstract = {Neurodevelopmental changes may underlie the brain dysfunction seen in schizophrenia. While advances have been made in our understanding of the genetics of schizophrenia, little is known about how non-genetic factors interact with genes for schizophrenia. The present analysis of genes potentially associated with schizophrenia is based on the observation that hypoxia prevails in the embryonic and fetal brain, and that interactions between neuronal genes, molecular regulators of hypoxia, such as hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), and intrinsic hypoxia occur in the developing brain and may create the conditions for complex changes in neurodevelopment. Consequently, we searched the literature for currently hypothesized candidate genes for susceptibility to schizophrenia that may be subject to ischemia-hypoxia regulation and/or associated with vascular expression. Genes were considered when at least two independent reports of a significant association with schizophrenia had appeared in the literature. The analysis showed that more than 50{\%} of these genes, particularly AKT1, BDNF, CAPON, CCKAR, CHRNA7, CNR1, COMT, DNTBP1, GAD1, GRM3, IL10, MLC1, NOTCH4, NRG1, NR4A2/NURR1, PRODH, RELN, RGS4, RTN4/NOGO and TNF, are subject to regulation by hypoxia and/or are expressed in the vasculature. Future studies of genes proposed as candidates for susceptibility to schizophrenia should include their possible regulation by physiological or pathological hypoxia during development as well as their potential role in cerebral vascular function.},

Here we show that alpha N-catenin, a linker between cadherin adhesion receptors and the actin cytoskeleton, is essential for stabilizing dendritic spines in rodent hippocampal neurons in culture. In the absence of alpha N-catenin, spine heads were abnormally motile, actively protruding filopodia from their synaptic contact sites. Conversely, alpha N-catenin overexpression in dendrites reduced spine turnover, causing an increase in spine and synapse density. Tetrodotoxin (TTX), a neural activity blocker, suppressed the synaptic accumulation of alpha N-catenin, whereas bicuculline, a GABA antagonist, promoted it. Furthermore, excess alpha N-catenin rendered spines resistant to the TTX treatment. These results suggest that alpha N-catenin is a key regulator for the stability of synaptic contacts.},

Global proteomic analysis of post-mortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples from schizophrenia patients and non-schizophrenic individuals was performed using stable isotope labeling and shotgun proteomics. The analysis resulted in the identification of 1,261 proteins, 84 of which showed statistically significant differential expression, reinforcing previous data supporting the involvement of the immune system, calcium homeostasis, cytoskeleton assembly, and energy metabolism in schizophrenia. In addition a number of new potential markers were found that may contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis of this complex disease.},

abstract = {Multiple studies have confirmed the contribution of rare de novo copy number variations to the risk for autism spectrum disorders. But whereas de novo single nucleotide variants have been identified in affected individuals, their contribution to risk has yet to be clarified. Specifically, the frequency and distribution of these mutations have not been well characterized in matched unaffected controls, and such data are vital to the interpretation of de novo coding mutations observed in probands. Here we show, using whole-exome sequencing of 928 individuals, including 200 phenotypically discordant sibling pairs, that highly disruptive (nonsense and splice-site) de novo mutations in brain-expressed genes are associated with autism spectrum disorders and carry large effects. On the basis of mutation rates in unaffected individuals, we demonstrate that multiple independent de novo single nucleotide variants in the same gene among unrelated probands reliably identifies risk alleles, providing a clear path forward for gene discovery. Among a total of 279 identified de novo coding mutations, there is a single instance in probands, and none in siblings, in which two independent nonsense variants disrupt the same gene, SCN2A (sodium channel, voltage-gated, type II, alpha subunit), a result that is highly unlikely by chance.},

abstract = {Maternal infection during pregnancy is associated with a higher incidence of mental disorders, including schizophrenia, in the offspring in later life. Our recent attempt to study this link between prenatal immunological challenge and subsequent psychopathology has led to the establishment of a mouse model demonstrating the emergence of multiple psychotic-like phenotypes following immunological challenge on gestation day (GD) 9. However, little is known about the impact of similar in utero challenge at different times of pregnancy. Here, we compare the efficacy of identical maternal immune stimulation induced by the exposure to polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid (Poly(I:C)) at a dose of 5mg/kg (i.v.) on distinct days of gestation (GD 6, 9, 13 or 17). The offspring derived were then compared to those collected from vehicle- and non-treated dams in two paradigms of selective associative learning: latent inhibition (LI) and the US-pre-exposure effect (USPEE). LI deficiency was observed in animals born to dams treated with Poly(I:C) on GD 6, 9 or 13, but not in those on GD17. In contrast, a loss of the USPEE was equivalently seen in all Poly(I:C) treatment groups, regardless of treatment times. Evaluation of the acute cytokine response in a separate cohort of pregnant dams receiving Poly(I:C) challenge on either GD9 or GD17 revealed that the ratio of interleukin-10/tumor necrosis factor-alpha was elevated in the GD17 relative to the GD9 group. The present report thus provides evidence that the acute cytokine reaction as well as the long-term pattern of behavioural sequelae of maternal immune challenge can be affected by its precise timing during pregnancy. The present study provides further support to the use of the prenatal Poly(I:C) model in the elucidation of mechanisms involved in the aetiology and disease process of immuno-precipitated neurodevelopmental mental diseases, including but not limited to, schizophrenia.},

@article{Corona2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interactions between fractalkine (CX3CL1) and fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) regulate microglial activation in the CNS. Recent findings indicate that age-associated impairments in CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 are directly associated with exaggerated microglial activation and an impaired recovery from sickness behavior after peripheral injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which an acute LPS injection causes amplified and prolonged microglial activation and behavioral deficits in CX3CR1-deficient mice (CX3CR1-/-). METHODS: CX3CR1-/- mice or control heterozygote mice (CX3CR1+/-) were injected with LPS (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) or saline and behavior (i.e., sickness and depression-like behavior), microglial activation, and markers of tryptophan metabolism were determined. All data were analyzed using Statistical Analysis Systems General Linear Model procedures and were subjected to one-, two-, or three-way ANOVA to determine significant main effects and interactions. RESULTS: LPS injection caused a prolonged duration of social withdrawal in CX3CR1-/- mice compared to control mice. This extended social withdrawal was associated with enhanced mRNA expression of IL-1beta, indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and kynurenine monooxygenase (KMO) in microglia 4 h after LPS. Moreover, elevated expression of IL-1beta and CD14 was still detected in microglia of CX3CR1-/- mice 24 h after LPS. There was also increased turnover of tryptophan, serotonin, and dopamine in the brain 24 h after LPS, but these increases were independent of CX3CR1 expression. When submitted to the tail suspension test 48 and 72 h after LPS, an increased duration of immobility was evident only in CX3CR1-/- mice. This depression-like behavior in CX3CR1-/- mice was associated with a persistent activated microglial phenotype in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data indicate that a deficiency of CX3CR1 is permissive to protracted microglial activation and prolonged behavioral alterations in response to transient activation of the innate immune system.},

abstract = {Establishing the age of each mutation segregating in contemporary human populations is important to fully understand our evolutionary history and will help to facilitate the development of new approaches for disease-gene discovery. Large-scale surveys of human genetic variation have reported signatures of recent explosive population growth, notable for an excess of rare genetic variants, suggesting that many mutations arose recently. To more quantitatively assess the distribution of mutation ages, we resequenced 15,336 genes in 6,515 individuals of European American and African American ancestry and inferred the age of 1,146,401 autosomal single nucleotide variants (SNVs). We estimate that approximately 73{\%} of all protein-coding SNVs and approximately 86{\%} of SNVs predicted to be deleterious arose in the past 5,000–10,000 years. The average age of deleterious SNVs varied significantly across molecular pathways, and disease genes contained a significantly higher proportion of recently arisen deleterious SNVs than other genes. Furthermore, European Americans had an excess of deleterious variants in essential and Mendelian disease genes compared to African Americans, consistent with weaker purifying selection due to the Out-of-Africa dispersal. Our results better delimit the historical details of human protein-coding variation, show the profound effect of recent human history on the burden of deleterious SNVs segregating in contemporary populations, and provide important practical information that can be used to prioritize variants in disease-gene discovery.},

abstract = {Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), the dominant form of brain injury in premature infants, is characterized by diffuse white matter injury and is associated with cerebral palsy (CP). Maternal and placental infections are major causes of prematurity and identifiable etiology of PVL and CP. Here we have evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a potent antioxidant and precursor of glutathione, to attenuate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced white matter injury and hypomyelination in the developing rat brain, an animal model of PVL. Intraperitoneal pretreatment of pregnant female rats with NAC (50 mg/kg), 2 hr prior to administration of LPS at embryonic day 18 (E18), attenuated the LPS-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and inducible nitric oxide synthase in fetal rat brains. There were significantly reduced numbers of TUNEL(+) nuclei coimmunostained for platelet-derived growth factor-alphaR(+) [a surface marker for oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs)] at E20 in the subventricular zone of fetal rat brain in the NAC + LPS group compared with the untreated LPS group. Interestingly, immunostaining for O4 and O1 as markers for late OPCs and immature oligodendrocytes demonstrated fewer O4(+) and O1(+) cells in the LPS group compared with the NAC + LPS and control groups. Consistent with O4(+)/O1(+) cell counts, the expression of myelin proteins such as myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, and 2'3'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, including transcription factors such as MyT1 and Gtx, was less in the LPS group at late postnatal days, indicating severe hypomyelination in the developing rat brain when compared with NAC + LPS and control groups. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that NAC may provide neuroprotection and attenuate the degeneration of OPCs against LPS evoked inflammatory response and white matter injury in developing rat brain. Moreover, these data suggest the possible use of NAC as a treatment for pregnant women with maternal or placental infection as a means of minimizing the risk of PVL and CP.},

abstract = {WAGR (Wilms tumor, Aniridia, Genitourinary malformations and mental Retardation) syndrome is a rare genomic disorder caused by deletion of the 11p14-p12 chromosome region. The majority of WAGR patients have mental retardation and behavioral problems, and more than 20{\%} of the patients also have features of autism. While the Wilms tumor/genitourinary anomalies and aniridia are caused by deletion of WT1 and PAX6 respectively, the genomic cause of mental retardation and autism in WAGR syndrome remains unknown. Using oligonucleotide arrays, we have characterized the 11p14-p12 deletions in 31 patients and identified all the genes involved in each deletion. The deletions had sizes ranging from 4.9 to 23 Mb that encompass 18-62 genes (40 on average). In addition to WT1 and PAX6, all the patients had deletion of PRRG4 (transmembrane gamma-carboxyglutamic acid protein 4). The majority of them had deletion of BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) and SLC1A2 [solute carrier family 1 (glial high affinity glutamate transporter) member 2]. Deletion of BDNF and SLC1A2 occurred in patients with autism more frequently than in those without autism. Literature review on the functions of the genes suggests that haploinsufficiency of SLC1A2, PRRG4, and BDNF may contribute to mental retardation and behavioral problems. In particular, BDNF may modulate the risk of autism in WAGR patients as suggested by its link with Rett syndrome as a target of MECP2. We observed that all the de novo deletions occurred in the chromosome 11 inherited from the father in the families genotyped, implying a predisposition for de novo mutations occurring in spermatogenesis and possible involvement of imprinting in cognitive impairment in WAGR patients.},

abstract = {Key pathological processes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) include the accumulation of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) which, in excess, triggers pathological cascades including widespread inflammation, partly reflected by chronic microglial activation. It has previously been suggested that CD40/CD40L interaction promotes AD like pathology in transgenic mice. Thus, amyloid burden, gliosis and hyperphosphorylation of tau are all reduced in transgenic models of AD lacking functional CD40L. We therefore hypothesized that cellular events leading to altered APP metabolism, inflammation and increased tau phosphorylation underlying these observations would be regulated at the genomic level. In the present report, we used the Affymetrix (GeneChip) oligonucleotide microarray U133A to gain insight into the global and simultaneous transcriptomic changes in response to microglia activation after CD40/CD40L ligation. As expected, regulation of elements of the NF-kappaB signaling, chemokine and B cell signaling pathways was observed. Taken together, our data also suggest that CD40 ligation in human microglia specifically perturbs many genes associated with APP processing.},

abstract = {The chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1, SDF-1, is an important regulator of leukocyte and hematopoietic precursor migration and pre-B cell proliferation. The receptor for SDF-1, CXCR4, also functions as a coreceptor for T-tropic HIV-1 entry. We find that mice deficient for CXCR4 die perinatally and display profound defects in the hematopoietic and nervous systems. CXCR4-deficient mice have severely reduced B-lymphopoiesis, reduced myelopoiesis in fetal liver, and a virtual absence of myelopoiesis in bone marrow. However, T-lymphopoiesis is unaffected. Furthermore, the cerebellum develops abnormally with an irregular external granule cell layer, ectopically located Purkinje cells, and numerous chromophilic cell clumps of abnormally migrated granule cells within the cerebellar anlage. Identical defects are observed in mice lacking SDF-1, suggesting a monogamous relationship between CXCR4 and SDF-1. This receptor-ligand selectivity is unusual among chemokines and their receptors, as is the function in migration of nonhematopoietic cells.},

@article{Purcell2014,
abstract = {Schizophrenia is a common disease with a complex aetiology, probably involving multiple and heterogeneous genetic factors. Here, by analysing the exome sequences of 2,536 schizophrenia cases and 2,543 controls, we demonstrate a polygenic burden primarily arising from rare (less than 1 in 10,000), disruptive mutations distributed across many genes. Particularly enriched gene sets include the voltage-gated calcium ion channel and the signalling complex formed by the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated scaffold protein (ARC) of the postsynaptic density, sets previously implicated by genome-wide association and copy-number variation studies. Similar to reports in autism, targets of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP, product of FMR1) are enriched for case mutations. No individual gene-based test achieves significance after correction for multiple testing and we do not detect any alleles of moderately low frequency (approximately 0.5 to 1 per cent) and moderately large effect. Taken together, these data suggest that population-based exome sequencing can discover risk alleles and complements established gene-mapping paradigms in neuropsychiatric disease.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We assessed the mutation frequency in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits CHRNA4, CHRNB2, and CHRNA2 in a cohort including autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) and sporadic nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE). Upon finding a novel mutation in CHRNA2 in a large family, we tested in vitro its functional effects. METHODS: We sequenced all the coding exons and their flanking intronic regions in 150 probands (73 NFLE, 77 ADNFLE), in most of whom diagnosis had been validated by EEG recording of seizures. Upon finding a missense mutation in CHRNA2, we measured whole-cell currents in human embryonic kidney cells in both wild-type and mutant alpha2beta4 and alpha2beta2 nAChR subtypes stimulated with nicotine. RESULTS: We found a c.889A>T (p.Ile297Phe) mutation in the proband ( approximately 0.6{\%} of the whole cohort) of a large ADNFLE family (1.2{\%} of familial cases) and confirmed its segregation in all 6 living affected individuals. Video-EEG studies demonstrated sleep-related paroxysmal epileptic arousals in all mutation carriers. Oxcarbazepine treatment was effective in all. Whole-cell current density was reduced to about 40{\%} in heterozygosity and to 0{\%} in homozygosity, with minor effects on channel permeability and sensitivity to nicotine. CONCLUSION: ADNFLE had previously been associated with CHRNA2 dysfunction in one family, in which a gain of function mutation was demonstrated. We confirm the causative role of CHRNA2 mutations in ADNFLE and demonstrate that also loss of function of alpha2 nAChRs may have pathogenic effects. CHRNA2 mutations are a rare cause of ADNFLE but this gene should be included in mutation screening.},

@article{Derecki2012,
abstract = {Rett syndrome is an X-linked autism spectrum disorder. The disease is characterized in most cases by mutation of the MECP2 gene, which encodes a methyl-CpG-binding protein. Although MECP2 is expressed in many tissues, the disease is generally attributed to a primary neuronal dysfunction. However, as shown recently, glia, specifically astrocytes, also contribute to Rett pathophysiology. Here we examine the role of another form of glia, microglia, in a murine model of Rett syndrome. Transplantation of wild-type bone marrow into irradiation-conditioned Mecp2-null hosts resulted in engraftment of brain parenchyma by bone-marrow-derived myeloid cells of microglial phenotype, and arrest of disease development. However, when cranial irradiation was blocked by lead shield, and microglial engraftment was prevented, disease was not arrested. Similarly, targeted expression of MECP2 in myeloid cells, driven by Lysm(cre) on an Mecp2-null background, markedly attenuated disease symptoms. Thus, through multiple approaches, wild-type Mecp2-expressing microglia within the context of an Mecp2-null male mouse arrested numerous facets of disease pathology: lifespan was increased, breathing patterns were normalized, apnoeas were reduced, body weight was increased to near that of wild type, and locomotor activity was improved. Mecp2(+/-) females also showed significant improvements as a result of wild-type microglial engraftment. These benefits mediated by wild-type microglia, however, were diminished when phagocytic activity was inhibited pharmacologically by using annexin V to block phosphatydilserine residues on apoptotic targets, thus preventing recognition and engulfment by tissue-resident phagocytes. These results suggest the importance of microglial phagocytic activity in Rett syndrome. Our data implicate microglia as major players in the pathophysiology of this devastating disorder, and suggest that bone marrow transplantation might offer a feasible therapeutic approach for it.},

abstract = {Immune alterations in schizophrenia have been described for decades. However, modern immunological methods and new insights into the highly developed and functionally differentiated immune system allow an integrative view of both the older and also more recent findings of immunological abnormalities in schizophrenia. The conceptual advances in immunology require the re-evaluation of elder immunological findings in schizophrenia. In this overview, recent advances in immunological research regarding the differentiation between T-Helper-1 and T-Helper-2 cells and between the so-called specific and unspecific arms of the immune system are discussed. The unspecific "innate" immune system shows signs of an over-activation in unmedicated schizophrenic patients, as increased monocytes and gamma delta-cells point to. Increased levels of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the activation of the IL-6 system in schizophrenia might be the result of the activation of monocytes/macrophages, too. In contrast, several parameters of the specific cellular immune system are blunted, e.g. the decreased T-helper-1 (TH-1) related immune parameters in schizophrenic patients, both in vitro and in vivo. It seems that a TH-1-TH-2 imbalance with a shift to the TH-2 system is associated with schizophrenia. During therapy with antipsychotics, the specific TH-1 related immune answer becomes activated, but the B-cell system and the antibody production become activated too.},

abstract = {Maternal infection during pregnancy increases the risk of schizophrenia and other brain disorders of neurodevelopmental origin in the offspring. A multitude of infectious agents seem to be involved in this association. Therefore, it has been proposed that factors common to the immune response to a wide variety of bacterial and viral pathogens may be the critical link between prenatal infection and postnatal brain and behavioral pathology. More specifically, it has been suggested that the maternal induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines may mediate the neurodevelopmental effects of maternal infections. Here, we review recent findings from in vitro and in vivo investigations supporting this hypothesis and further emphasize the influence of enhanced anti-inflammatory cytokine signaling on early brain development. Disruption of the fetal brain balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine signaling may thus represent a key mechanism involved in the precipitation of schizophrenia-related pathology following prenatal maternal infection and innate immune imbalances.},

abstract = {Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a transcriptional regulator that plays a key role in many aspects of oxygen homeostasis. The heterodimeric HIF complex is regulated by proteolysis of its alpha-subunits, following oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of specific prolyl residues. Although three HIF prolyl hydroxylases, PHD1, PHD2, and PHD3, have been identified that have the potential to catalyze this reaction, the contribution of each isoform to the physiological regulation of HIF remains uncertain. Here we show using suppression by small interference RNA that each of the three PHD isoforms contributes in a non-redundant manner to the regulation of both HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha subunits and that the contribution of each PHD under particular culture conditions is strongly dependent on the abundance of the enzyme. Thus in different cell types, isoform-specific patterns of PHD induction by hypoxia and estrogen alter both the relative abundance of the PHDs and their relative contribution to the regulation of HIF. In addition, the PHDs manifest specificity for different prolyl hydroxylation sites within each HIF-alpha subunit, and a degree of selectively between HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha isoforms, indicating that differential PHD inhibition has the potential to selectively alter the characteristics of HIF activation.},

abstract = {Induction of proinflammatory cytokines has been proposed to be a link between prenatal maternal intrauterine infection and neonatal brain damage. It is known that the endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), released during bacterial infection crosses the placenta. Cytokine induction in the fetal rat brain after maternal administration of LPS was determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction method. LPS suspension in pyrogen-free saline was administered (i.p.) to pregnant rats at 18 d of gestation. The control group was treated with pyrogen-free saline. Expression of the proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and IL-1beta mRNA, in the fetal rat brain was increased in a dose-dependent manner at 1 h after LPS administration. The great increase in expression of IL-1beta mRNA was only observed at 1 h after injection of LPS (4 mg/kg), whereas the increased expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha was still detectable from 4 to 24 h after LPS administration. Brain injuries were examined by immunohistochemistry in 8-d-old rat pups born to the dams that were consecutively treated with LPS (500 microg/kg) or pyrogen-free saline on gestation d 18 and 19. No apparent necrotic tissue damage was found in either the LPS group or the control group. Myelin basic protein staining, as a marker of myelin, was clearly observed in the internal capsule and the fimbria hippocampus in the rat brain from the control group. Myelin basic protein staining was much less and weaker in the brains of the LPS-treated group. Glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes were observed in both the control and the LPS-treated groups. The LPS-treated group appeared to have more glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes in the hippocampal and the cortex areas of the brain than the control group. Immunoblotting data showed that glial fibrillary acidic protein content in the cortex or the hippocampus of the LPS-treated rat brain was higher than in the control group. OX-42-positive staining (a marker of the type 3 complement receptors) of microglial cells was greatly reduced in the 8-d-old rat brain after maternal LPS administration. However, histochemistry with tomato lectin showed that staining of both amoeboid and ramified microglial cells in the LPS-treated rat brain was similar to that in the control group. The overall results indicate that maternal LPS administration induces an increased expression of IL-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA in the fetal brain. Maternal LPS administration also increases glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes, decreases myelin basic protein and alters immunoreactivity of microglia in the brain of offspring. Although results from the current study do not provide direct evidence linking LPS-induced cytokines with the abnormalities in the neonatal rat brain, our animal model may be appropriate for exploring the mechanisms involved in the effects of maternal infection on glial cells in the brains of offspring.},

abstract = {Maternal infection during prenatal life is a risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia and autism, in the offspring. We and others have reported white mater microstructure abnormalities in prefrontal-striato-temporal networks in these disorders. In addition we have shown that early rather than late maternal immune challenge in the mouse model precipitates ventricular volume change and impairs sensorimotor gating similar to that found in schizophrenia. However, it is not known whether the timing of maternal infection has a differential impact upon white matter microstructural indices. Therefore this study directly tested the effect of early or late gestation maternal immune activation on post-natal white matter microstructure in the mouse. The viral mimic PolyI:C was administered on day 9 or day 17 of gestation. In-vivo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was carried out when the offspring reached adulthood. We describe a novel application of voxel-based analysis to evaluate fractional anisotrophy (FA). In addition we conducted a preliminary immunohistochemical exploration of the oligodendrocyte marker, 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase), to determine whether differences in myelination might contribute to any changes in FA observed. Our results provide experimental evidence that prenatal exposure to inflammation elicits widespread differences in FA throughout fronto-striatal-limbic circuits compared to control saline exposure. Moreover, FA changes were more extensive in the group exposed earliest in gestation.},

abstract = {The generation of neurons and glia in the developing nervous system is likely to be regulated by extrinsic factors, including growth factors and neurotransmitters. Evidence from in vivo and/or in vitro systems indicates that basic fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha, insulin-like growth factor-1, and the monoamine neurotransmitters act to increase proliferation of neural precursors. Conversely, glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and opioid peptides are likely to play a role in down-regulating proliferation in the developing nervous system. Several other factors, including the neuropeptides vasoactive intestinal peptide and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide, as well as the growth factors platelet-derived growth factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and members of the TGF-beta family, have different effects on proliferation and differentiation depending on the system examined. Expression of many of these factors and their receptors in germinal regions of the central nervous system suggests that they can act directly on precursor populations to control their proliferation. Together, the findings discussed here indicate that proliferation and cell fate determination in the developing brain are regulated extrinsically by complex interactions between a relatively large number of growth factors and neurotransmitters.},

abstract = {Analyzing vertebrate genomes requires rapid mRNA/DNA and cross-species protein alignments. A new tool, BLAT, is more accurate and 500 times faster than popular existing tools for mRNA/DNA alignments and 50 times faster for protein alignments at sensitivity settings typically used when comparing vertebrate sequences. BLAT's speed stems from an index of all nonoverlapping K-mers in the genome. This index fits inside the RAM of inexpensive computers, and need only be computed once for each genome assembly. BLAT has several major stages. It uses the index to find regions in the genome likely to be homologous to the query sequence. It performs an alignment between homologous regions. It stitches together these aligned regions (often exons) into larger alignments (typically genes). Finally, BLAT revisits small internal exons possibly missed at the first stage and adjusts large gap boundaries that have canonical splice sites where feasible. This paper describes how BLAT was optimized. Effects on speed and sensitivity are explored for various K-mer sizes, mismatch schemes, and number of required index matches. BLAT is compared with other alignment programs on various test sets and then used in several genome-wide applications. http://genome.ucsc.edu hosts a web-based BLAT server for the human genome.},

@article{Li2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA-Seq is revolutionizing the way transcript abundances are measured. A key challenge in transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data is the handling of reads that map to multiple genes or isoforms. This issue is particularly important for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies in the absence of sequenced genomes, as it is difficult to determine which transcripts are isoforms of the same gene. A second significant issue is the design of RNA-Seq experiments, in terms of the number of reads, read length, and whether reads come from one or both ends of cDNA fragments. RESULTS: We present RSEM, an user-friendly software package for quantifying gene and isoform abundances from single-end or paired-end RNA-Seq data. RSEM outputs abundance estimates, 95{\%} credibility intervals, and visualization files and can also simulate RNA-Seq data. In contrast to other existing tools, the software does not require a reference genome. Thus, in combination with a de novo transcriptome assembler, RSEM enables accurate transcript quantification for species without sequenced genomes. On simulated and real data sets, RSEM has superior or comparable performance to quantification methods that rely on a reference genome. Taking advantage of RSEM's ability to effectively use ambiguously-mapping reads, we show that accurate gene-level abundance estimates are best obtained with large numbers of short single-end reads. On the other hand, estimates of the relative frequencies of isoforms within single genes may be improved through the use of paired-end reads, depending on the number of possible splice forms for each gene. CONCLUSIONS: RSEM is an accurate and user-friendly software tool for quantifying transcript abundances from RNA-Seq data. As it does not rely on the existence of a reference genome, it is particularly useful for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies. In addition, RSEM has enabled valuable guidance for cost-efficient design of quantification experiments with RNA-Seq, which is currently relatively expensive.},

abstract = {Reelin is a neuroprotein with crucial role during neurodevelopment and also in postnatal period. It regulates neuronal migration and positioning in developing neocortex and cerebellar cortex. Postnatally it participates in regulation of dendritic and axonal growth, synaptogenesis, neurotransmission and it contribute to synaptic plasticity necessary for learning and memory functions. Role of Reelin seems to be rather complex, profound research gradually uncovers its further functions. Deficits of Reelin were detected in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism. Pathogenesis of these disorders is far from being clearly understood. Reelin contribution to these diseases seems to be vital, since genetic variants of Reelin were associated with these diseases and often influence symptom severity. Reelin is a promising candidate molecule with potential future use in diagnostics and therapy, however further detailed research is essential.},

abstract = {Cytokines are pleotrophic proteins that coordinate the host response to infection as well as mediate normal, ongoing signaling between cells of nonimmune tissues, including the nervous system. As a consequence of this dual role, cytokines induced in response to maternal infection or prenatal hypoxia can profoundly impact fetal neurodevelopment. The neurodevelopmental roles of individual cytokine signaling pathways are being elucidated through gain- and loss-of-function studies in cell culture and model organisms. We review this work with a particular emphasis on studies where cytokines, their receptors, or components of their signaling pathways have been altered in vivo. The extensive and diverse requirements for properly regulated cytokine signaling during normal nervous system development revealed by these studies sets the foundation for ongoing and future work aimed at understanding how cytokines induced normally and pathologically during critical stages of fetal development alter nervous system function and behavior later in life.},

abstract = {Association of both environmental and hereditary factors in susceptibility to schizophrenia is well established. Initial diagnosis of schizophrenia in a genetically susceptible individual usually occurs the first time that individual faces a great life-time stressful event. Immune system dysfunction is one of the major factors implicated in the etiology of schizophrenia because it can render an individual more vulnerable to stress. Imbalance between type-1 and type-2 immunity and subsequent alterations in cytokine levels have been reported in schizophrenia patients. Cytokines seem to have neurotropic activities associated with neurologic disorders, suggesting their complex role in the central nervous system (CNS). On the other hand, it is well known that CpG methylation strongly associates with silencing of genes in differentiated cells at the transcriptional level and variation in genomic DNA methylation of cytokine genes and T cells is an important factor modulating cytokine gene expression in various conditions. Therefore, it could be hypothesized that alterations in methylation pattern of selective cytokine gene promoters be regarded as an underlying mechanism of Th1/Th2 imbalance observed in schizophrenia. Environmental triggers including feto-maternal transmission of viral or bacterial micro-organisms, change in enzymatic activities, or interaction of environmental and genetic factors in individuals with a higher risk of schizophrenia might orchestrate this mechanism.},

@article{LoTurco1995,
abstract = {We have found that, during the early stages of cortical neurogenesis, both GABA and glutamate depolarize cells in the ventricular zone of rat embryonic neocortex. In the ventricular zone, glutamate acts on AMPA/kainate receptors, while GABA acts on GABAA receptors. GABA induces an inward current at resting membrane potentials, presumably owing to a high intracellular Cl- concentration maintained by furosemide-sensitive Cl- transport. GABA and glutamate also produce increases in intracellular Ca2+ in ventricular zone cells, in part through activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Furthermore, GABA and glutamate decrease the number of embryonic cortical cells synthesizing DNA. Depolarization with K+ similarly decreases DNA synthesis, suggesting that the neurotransmitters act via membrane depolarization. Applied alone, GABAA and AMPA/kainate receptor antagonists increase DNA synthesis, indicating that endogenously released amino acids influence neocortical progenitors in the cell cycle. These results demonstrate a novel role for amino acid neurotransmitters in regulating neocortical neurogenesis.},

abstract = {Maternal immune activation during prenatal development, including treatment with the viral RNA mimic, polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid (poly IC), serves as a widely used animal model to induce behavioral deficits reminiscent of schizophrenia and related disease. Here, we report that massive cytokine activation after a single dose of poly IC in the prenatal period is associated with lasting working memory deficits in adult offspring. To explore whether dysregulated gene expression in cerebral cortex, contributes to cognitive dysfunction, we profiled the cortical transcriptome, and in addition, mapped the genome-wide distribution of trimethylated histone H3-lysine 4 (H3K4me3), an epigenetic mark sharply regulated at the 5' end of transcriptional units. However, deep sequencing-based H3K4me3 mapping and mRNA profiling by microarray did not reveal significant alterations in mature cerebral cortex after poly IC exposure at embryonic days E17.5 or E12.5. At a small set of genes (including suppressor of cytokine signaling Socs3), H3K4me3 was sensitive to activation of cytokine signaling in primary cultures from fetal forebrain but adult cortex of saline- and poly IC-exposed mice did not show significant differences. A limited set of transcription start sites (TSS), including Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (Disc1), a schizophrenia risk gene often implicated in gene-environment interaction models, showed altered H3K4me3 after prenatal poly IC but none of these differences survived after correcting for multiple comparisons. We conclude that prenatal poly IC is associated with cognitive deficits later in life, but without robust alterations in epigenetic regulation of gene expression in the cerebral cortex.},

@article{Johnson2007,
abstract = {Non-biological experimental variation or "batch effects" are commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes ( > 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice. Software for our method is freely available at: http://biosun1.harvard.edu/complab/batch/.},

We surveyed the poly(A)(+) transcriptomes of undifferentiated mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and embryoid bodies (EBs) at an unprecedented depth (10 Gb), using the Applied Biosystems SOLiD technology. These libraries capture the genomic landscape of expression, state-specific expression, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the transcriptional activity of repeat elements, and both known and new alternative splicing events. We investigated the impact of transcriptional complexity on current models of key signaling pathways controlling ESC pluripotency and differentiation, highlighting how SQRL can be used to characterize transcriptome content and dynamics in a quantitative and reproducible manner, and suggesting that our understanding of transcriptional complexity is far from complete.},

Their roles in homeostasis and in distinguishing self from non-self have evolved with the complexity of organisms and their immune systems. Equally important, but often overlooked, are the roles of macrophages in tissue development. As discussed in this Review, these include functions in branching morphogenesis, neuronal patterning, angiogenesis, bone morphogenesis and the generation of adipose tissue. In each case, macrophage depletion impairs the formation of the tissue and compromises its function. I argue that in several diseases, the unrestrained acquisition of these developmental macrophage functions exacerbates pathology. For example, macrophages enhance tumour progression and metastasis by affecting tumour-cell migration and invasion, as well as angiogenesis.},

abstract = {Cultivated rye (Secale cereale L., 2n = 2x = 14, RR) is an important source of genes for insect and disease resistance in wheat (Triticum aestivum L., 2n = 6x = 42). Rye chromosome arm 1RS of S. cereale 'Kavkaz' originally found as a 1BL.1RS translocation, carries genes for disease resistance (e.g., Lr26, Sr31, Yr9, and Pm8), while 1RS of the S. cereale 'Amigo' translocation (1RSA) carries a single resistance gene for greenbug (Schizaphis graminum Rondani) biotypes B and C and also carries additional disease-resistance genes. The purpose of this research was to identify individual plants that were recombinant in the homologous region of.1AL.1RSV and 1AL.1RSA using both molecular and phenotypic markers. Secale cereale 'Nekota' (1AL.1RSA) and S. cereale 'Pavon 76' (1AL.1RSV) were mated and the F1 was backcrossed to 'Nekota' (1AL.1AS) to generate eighty BC1F2:3 families (i.e., ('Nekota' 1AL.1RSA x 'Pavon 76' 1AL.1RSV) x 'Nekota' 1AL.1AS). These families were genotyped using the secalin-gliadin grain storage protein banding pattern generated with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to discriminate 1AL.1AS/1AL.1RS heterozygotes from the 1AL.1RSA+V and 1AL.1AS homozygotes. Segregation of the secalin locus and PCR markers based on the R173 family of rye specific repeated DNA sequences demonstrated the presence of recombinant 1AL.1RSA+V families. Powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis) and greenbug resistance genes on the recombinant 1RSA+V arm were mapped in relation to the Sec-1 locus, 2 additional protein bands, 3 SSRs, and 13 RFLP markers. The resultant linkage map of 1RS spanned 82.4 cM with marker order and spacing showing reasonable agreement with previous maps of 1RS. Fifteen markers lie within a region of 29.7 cM next to the centromere, yet corresponded to just 36{\%} of the overall map length. The map position of the RFLP marker probe mwg68 was 10.9 cM distal to the Sec-1 locus and 7.8 cM proximal to the powdery mildew resistance locus. The greenbug resistance gene was located 2.7 cM proximal to the Sec-1 locus.},

abstract = {Of the many signals in the developing nervous system, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) has been shown to be one of the earliest neurotransmitters present. Unlike in the adult, where this transmitter acts synaptically to inhibit neurons, during development, GABA can depolarize progenitor cells and their progeny due to their high intracellular chloride concentration. This early form of GABA signalling may provide the main excitatory drive for the immature cortical network and play a central role in regulating cortical development. Many features of GABA signalling are conserved in different species and are recapitulated during neurogenesis in the adult brain, demonstrating the importance of this versatile molecule in driving cortical formation. Here, we present recent evidence supporting the multiple functions of GABA during embryonic development and adult neurogenesis, from regulating progenitor proliferation to influencing the migration and maturation of newborn neurons.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), a main component of the brain extracellular matrix, regulate developmental and adult neural functions that are highly relevant to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Such functions, together with marked expression of CSPGs in astrocytes within the normal human amygdala and evidence of a disruption of astrocytic functions in this disease, point to involvement of CSPG-glial interactions in schizophrenia. HYPOTHESIS: Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan-related abnormalities involve glial cells and extracellular matrix pericellular aggregates (perineuronal nets) in the amygdala and entorhinal cortex of subjects with schizophrenia. DESIGN: Postmortem case-control study. SETTING: The Translational Neuroscience Laboratory at McLean Hospital, Harvard Medical School. Specimens were obtained from the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center at McLean Hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Two separate cohorts of healthy control (n = 15; n = 10) and schizophrenic (n = 11; n = 10) subjects and a cohort of subjects with bipolar disorder (n = 11). INTERVENTIONS: Quantitative, immunocytological, and histological postmortem investigations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Numerical densities of CSPG-positive glial cells and perineuronal nets, glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes, and total numbers of parvalbumin-positive neurons in the deep amygdala nuclei and entorhinal cortex. RESULTS: In schizophrenia, massive increases in CSPG-positive glial cells were detected in the deep amygdala nuclei (419{\%}-1162{\%}) and entorhinal cortex (layer II; 480{\%}-1560{\%}). Perineuronal nets were reduced in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala and lateral entorhinal cortex (layer II). Numerical densities of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive glial cells and total numbers of parvalbumin-positive neurons were unaltered. Changes in CSPG-positive elements were negligible in subjects with bipolar disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Marked changes in functionally relevant molecules in schizophrenia point to a pivotal role for extracellular matrix-glial interactions in the pathogenesis of this disease. Disruption of these interactions, unsuspected thus far, may represent a unifying factor contributing to disturbances of neuronal migration, synaptic connectivity, and GABAergic, glutamatergic, and dopaminergic neurotransmission in schizophrenia. The lack of CSPG abnormalities in bipolar disorder points to a distinctive aspect of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia in key medial temporal lobe regions.},

abstract = {Autism is a severe neurobehavioral syndrome, arising largely as an inherited disorder, which can arise from several diseases. Despite recent advances in identifying some genes that can cause autism, its underlying neurological mechanisms are uncertain. Autism is best conceptualized by considering the neural systems that may be defective in autistic individuals. Recent advances in understanding neural systems that process sensory information, various types of memories and social and emotional behaviors are reviewed and compared with known abnormalities in autism. Then, specific genetic abnormalities that are linked with autism are examined. Synthesis of this information leads to a model that postulates that some forms of autism are caused by an increased ratio of excitation/inhibition in sensory, mnemonic, social and emotional systems. The model further postulates that the increased ratio of excitation/inhibition can be caused by combinatorial effects of genetic and environmental variables that impinge upon a given neural system. Furthermore, the model suggests potential therapeutic interventions.},

@article{Meyer2007a,
abstract = {Environmental insults taking place in early brain development may have long-lasting consequences for adult brain functioning. There is a large body of epidemiological data linking maternal infections during pregnancy to a higher incidence of psychiatric disorders with a presumed neurodevelopmental origin in the offspring, including schizophrenia and autism. Although specific gestational windows may be associated with a differing vulnerability to infection-mediated disturbances in normal brain development, it still remains debatable whether and/or why certain gestation periods may confer maximal risk for neurodevelopmental disturbances following the prenatal exposure to infectious events. In this review, the authors integrate both epidemiological and experimental findings supporting the hypothesis that infection-associated immunological events in early fetal life may have a stronger neurodevelopmental impact compared to late pregnancy infections. This is because infections in early gestation may not only interfere with fundamental neurodevelopmental events such as cell proliferation and differentiation, but it may also predispose the developing nervous system to additional failures in subsequent cell migration, target selection, and synapse maturation, eventually leading to multiple brain and behavioral abnormalities in the adult offspring. The temporal dependency of the epidemiological link between maternal infections during pregnancy and a higher risk for brain disorders in the offspring may thus be explained by specific spatiotemporal events in the course of fetal brain development.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS: To align our large (>80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of >50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 x 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90{\%} success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code. STAR is free open source software distributed under GPLv3 license and can be downloaded from http://code.google.com/p/rna-star/.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: It is expected that emerging digital gene expression (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.

Here we demonstrate that inhibition of the synthesis of each glutamate transporter subtype using chronic antisense oligonucleotide administration, in vitro and in vivo, selectively and specifically reduced the protein expression and function of glutamate transporters. The loss of glial glutamate transporters GLAST or GLT-1 produced elevated extracellular glutamate levels, neurodegeneration characteristic of excitotoxicity, and a progressive paralysis. The loss of the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1 did not elevate extracellular glutamate in the striatum but did produce mild neurotoxicity and resulted in epilepsy. These studies suggest that glial glutamate transporters provide the majority of functional glutamate transport and are essential for maintaining low extracellular glutamate and for preventing chronic glutamate neurotoxicity.},

We have investigated the expression of AIF-1 in 18 autopsy cases of human focal cerebral infarction. AIF-1-positive cells show the morphology of microglia and are CD68- but not GFAP-positive. The peptide is expressed at a low level in normal brain. In infarctions, activated microglial cells in the area of glial reaction show strongly enhanced cytoplasmic immunoreactivity. The density of AIF-1-expressing cells increases during the first three days post infarction and remains elevated until chronic cystic stages. The upregulation of AIF-1-immunoreactivity precedes the rise in expression of the S-100-protein MRP-8. We conclude that AIF-1 is a sensitive marker of human microglial activation not only in inflammation but also in non-inflammatory lesions of the CNS.},

abstract = {Pathologic study of the lesions caused by Microgemma ovoidea has shown that after the formation of the xenoma (stage 1), the parasitized cell is infiltrated by host macrophages (stage 2) and quickly encysted by the activity of fibroblasts that form a xenoma wall composed of collagenous fibers (stage 3). The phagocytic activity of the macrophages leads to the formation of a granuloma (stage 4) in which the cyst contents comprise macrophages filled with phagocytosed spores. This phagocytic activity is limited by the fact that some parts of the microsporidian spores, such as the spore walls, cannot be lysed by macrophages, which leads to the formation of fused giant cells containing nondigestible spore remanants. The final step in the process is healing (stage 5), in which some cells may start proliferating to regenerate the damaged area. Nevertheless, the host occasionally fails to control M. ovoidea infections. This failure can take two forms: bursting of the granuloma, or the appearance of secondary infections in granulomas, probably through parasitism of macrophages.},

Changes in microglial morphology and gene expression have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, it remains unknown whether these changes are a primary cause or a secondary consequence of neuronal deficits. Here we tested whether a primary deficit in microglia was sufficient to induce some autism-related behavioral and functional connectivity deficits. Mice lacking the chemokine receptor Cx3cr1 exhibit a transient reduction of microglia during the early postnatal period and a consequent deficit in synaptic pruning. We show that deficient synaptic pruning is associated with weak synaptic transmission, decreased functional brain connectivity, deficits in social interaction and increased repetitive-behavior phenotypes that have been previously associated with autism and other neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. These findings open the possibility that disruptions in microglia-mediated synaptic pruning could contribute to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders.},

In the cerebella of cdf/cdf homozygous mice, approximately 40{\%} of Purkinje cells are located ectopically in the white matter and inner granule-cell layer. Many hippocampal pyramidal cells are scattered in the plexiform layers, and those that are correctly positioned are less densely packed than are cells in wild-type mice. We show that fear conditioning and prepulse inhibition of the startle response are also disrupted in cdf/cdf mice. We identify a deletion on chromosome 6 that removes approximately 150 kb in the cdf critical region. The deletion includes part of Catna2, encoding alpha N-catenin, a protein that links the classical cadherins to the neuronal cytoskeleton. Expression of a Catna2 transgene in cdf/cdf mice restored normal cerebellar and hippocampal morphology, prepulse inhibition and fear conditioning. The findings suggest that catenin cadherin cell-adhesion complexes are important in cerebellar and hippocampal lamination and in the control of startle modulation.},

abstract = {Mammalian forebrain development requires extensive cell migration for cells to reach their appropriate location in the adult brain. Defects in this migration result in human malformations and neurologic deficits. Thus, understanding the mechanisms underlying normal cell migration during development is essential to understanding the pathogenesis of human malformations. Radial glia are known to support radial cell migration, while axons have been proposed as substrate for some non-radially migrating cells. Herein we have directly tested the hypothesis that axons can support non-radial cell migration. One population of cells known to migrate non-radially is the inhibitory interneurons that move from the ganglionic eminence to the cerebral cortex. We first show that early born GABAergic cells colocalize with TAG-1-positive (TAG-1+) axons, while later born cells colocalize with intermediate weight neurofilament-positive, TAG-1-negative (TAG-1-) processes, suggesting temporal differences in substrate specificities. We next developed an in vitro assay that allows us to observe cell migration on axons in culture. Using this assay we find that early born medial ganglionic eminence-derived interneurons migrate preferentially on TAG-1+ axons, while later born cells only migrate on neurofilament-positive/TAG-1- processes. These data provide the first direct evidence that ganglionic eminence cells migrate on axons and that there is an age-dependent substrate preference. Furthermore, the assay developed and characterized herein provides a robust method to further study the molecular substrates and guidance cues of axonophilic cell migration in neural development.},

@article{Kochunov2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Elevated rate of aging-related biological and functional decline, termed "accelerated aging," is reported in patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD). We used diffusion tensor imaging derived fractional anisotropy (FA) as a biomarker of aging-related decline in white matter (WM) integrity to test the hypotheses of accelerated aging in SCZ and MDD. METHODS: The SCZ cohort comprised 58 SCZ patients and 60 controls (aged 20-60 years). The MDD cohort comprised 136 MDD patients and 351 controls (aged 20-79 years). The main outcome measures were the diagnosis-by-age interaction on whole-brain-averaged WM FA values and FA values from 12 major WM tracts. RESULTS: Diagnosis-by-age interaction for the whole-brain average FA was significant for the SCZ (p = .04) but not the MDD (p = .80) cohort. Diagnosis-by-age interaction was nominally significant (p<.05) for five WM tracts for SCZ and for none of the tracts in the MDD cohort. Tract-specific heterochronicity of the onset of age-related decline in SCZ demonstrated strong negative correlations with the age-of-peak myelination and the rates of age-related decline obtained from normative sample (r =-.61 and-.80, p<.05, respectively). No such trends existed for MDD cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral WM showed accelerated aging in SCZ but not in MDD, suggesting some difference in the pathophysiology underlying their WM aging changes. Tract-specific heterochronicity of WM development modulated presentation of accelerated aging in SCZ: WM tracts that matured later in life appeared more sensitive to the pathophysiology of SCZ and demonstrated more susceptibility to disorder-related accelerated decline in FA values with age. This trend was not observed in MDD cohort.},

abstract = {Ordered differential display identified a novel sequence induced in neurons by the neurite-promoting protein amphoterin. We named this gene amphoterin-induced gene and ORF (AMIGO), and also cloned two other novel genes homologous to AMIGO (AMIGO2 and AMIGO3). Together, these three AMIGOs form a novel family of genes coding for type I transmembrane proteins which contain a signal sequence for secretion and a transmembrane domain. The deduced extracellular parts of the AMIGOs contain six leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) flanked by cysteine-rich LRR NH2- and COOH-terminal domains and by one immunoglobulin domain close to the transmembrane region. A substrate-bound form of the recombinant AMIGO ectodomain promoted prominent neurite extension in hippocampal neurons, and in solution, the same AMIGO ectodomain inhibited fasciculation of neurites. A homophilic and heterophilic binding mechanism is shown between the members of the AMIGO family. Our results suggest that the members of the AMIGO protein family are novel cell adhesion molecules among which AMIGO is specifically expressed on fiber tracts of neuronal tissues and participates in their formation.},

abstract = {In recent years, the introduction of massively parallel sequencing platforms for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) protocols, able to simultaneously sequence hundred thousand DNA fragments, dramatically changed the landscape of the genetics studies. RNA-Seq for transcriptome studies, Chip-Seq for DNA-proteins interaction, CNV-Seq for large genome nucleotide variations are only some of the intriguing new applications supported by these innovative platforms. Among them RNA-Seq is perhaps the most complex NGS application. Expression levels of specific genes, differential splicing, allele-specific expression of transcripts can be accurately determined by RNA-Seq experiments to address many biological-related issues. All these attributes are not readily achievable from previously widespread hybridization-based or tag sequence-based approaches. However, the unprecedented level of sensitivity and the large amount of available data produced by NGS platforms provide clear advantages as well as new challenges and issues. This technology brings the great power to make several new biological observations and discoveries, it also requires a considerable effort in the development of new bioinformatics tools to deal with these massive data files. The paper aims to give a survey of the RNA-Seq methodology, particularly focusing on the challenges that this application presents both from a biological and a bioinformatics point of view.},

However, although microglia have been shown to engulf and clear damaged cellular debris after brain insult, it remains less clear what role microglia play in the uninjured brain. Here, we show that microglia actively engulf synaptic material and play a major role in synaptic pruning during postnatal development in mice. These findings link microglia surveillance to synaptic maturation and suggest that deficits in microglia function may contribute to synaptic abnormalities seen in some neurodevelopmental disorders.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: In model organisms such as yeast, large databases of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions have become an extremely important resource for the study of protein function, evolution, and gene regulatory dynamics. In this paper we demonstrate that by integrating these interactions with widely-available mRNA expression data, it is possible to generate concrete hypotheses for the underlying mechanisms governing the observed changes in gene expression. To perform this integration systematically and at large scale, we introduce an approach for screening a molecular interaction network to identify active subnetworks, i.e., connected regions of the network that show significant changes in expression over particular subsets of conditions. The method we present here combines a rigorous statistical measure for scoring subnetworks with a search algorithm for identifying subnetworks with high score. RESULTS: We evaluated our procedure on a small network of 332 genes and 362 interactions and a large network of 4160 genes containing all 7462 protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions in the yeast public databases. In the case of the small network, we identified five significant subnetworks that covered 41 out of 77 (53{\%}) of all significant changes in expression. Both network analyses returned several top-scoring subnetworks with good correspondence to known regulatory mechanisms in the literature. These results demonstrate how large-scale genomic approaches may be used to uncover signalling and regulatory pathways in a systematic, integrative fashion.},

abstract = {We have conducted a genome screen of autism, by linkage analysis in an initial set of 90 multiplex sibships, with parents, containing 97 independent affected sib pairs (ASPs), with follow-up in 49 additional multiplex sibships, containing 50 ASPs. In total, 519 markers were genotyped, including 362 for the initial screen, and an additional 157 were genotyped in the follow-up. As a control, we also included in the analysis unaffected sibs, which provided 51 discordant sib pairs (DSPs) for the initial screen and 29 for the follow-up. In the initial phase of the work, we observed increased identity by descent (IBD) in the ASPs (sharing of 51.6{\%}) compared with the DSPs (sharing of 50.8{\%}). The excess sharing in the ASPs could not be attributed to the effect of a small number of loci but, rather, was due to the modest increase in the entire distribution of IBD. These results are most compatible with a model specifying a large number of loci (perhaps >/=15) and are less compatible with models specifying </=10 loci. The largest LOD score obtained in the initial scan was for a marker on chromosome 1p; this region also showed positive sharing in the replication family set, giving a maximum multipoint LOD score of 2.15 for both sets combined. Thus, there may exist a gene of moderate effect in this region. We had only modestly positive or negative linkage evidence in candidate regions identified in other studies. Our results suggest that positional cloning of susceptibility loci by linkage analysis may be a formidable task and that other approaches may be necessary.},

In this report, we examine the evidence from brain pathology (enlargement of the cerebroventricular system, changes in gray and white matters, and abnormal laminar organization), genetics (changes in the normal expression of proteins that are involved in early migration of neurons and glia, cell proliferation, axonal outgrowth, synaptogenesis, and apoptosis), environmental factors (increased frequency of obstetric complications and increased rates of schizophrenic births due to prenatal viral or bacterial infections), and gene-environmental interactions (a disproportionate number of schizophrenia candidate genes are regulated by hypoxia, microdeletions and microduplications, the overrepresentation of pathogen-related genes among schizophrenia candidate genes) in support of the neurodevelopmental model. We relate the neurodevelopmental model to a number of findings about schizophrenia. Finally, we also examine alternate explanations of the origin of schizophrenia including the neurodegenerative model.},

abstract = {The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database creates networks from interrelations between molecular biology and underlying chemical elements. This allows for analysis of biologic networks, genomic information, and higher-order functional information at a systems level. We performed microarray experiments and used the KEGG database, systems biology analysis, and annotation of pathway function to study nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced differentiation of PC12 cells. Cells were cultured to 70{\%}-80{\%} confluence, treated with NGF for 1 or 3 hours (h), and RNA was extracted. Stage 1 data analysis involved analysis of variance (ANOVA), and stage 2 involved cluster analysis and heat map generation. We identified 2020 NGF-induced PC12 genes (1038 at 1 h and 1554 at 3 h). Results showed changes in gene expression over time. We compared these genes with 6035 genes from the KEGG database. Cross-matching resulted in 830 genes. Among these, we identified 395 altered genes (155 at 1 h and 301 at 3 h; 2-fold increase from 1 h to 3 h). We identified 191 biologic pathways in the KEGG database; the top 15 showed correlations with neuronal differentiation (mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK] pathway: 35 genes at 1 h, 54 genes at 3 h; genes associated with axonal guidance: 12 at 1 h, 26 at 3 h; Wnt pathway: 16 at 1 h, 25 at 3 h; neurotrophin pathway: 4 at 1 h, 14 at 3 h). Thus, we identified changes in neuronal differentiation pathways with the KEGG database, which were synchronized with NGF-induced differentiation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most successful computational approaches for protein function prediction integrate multiple genomics and proteomics data sources to make inferences about the function of unknown proteins. The most accurate of these algorithms have long running times, making them unsuitable for real-time protein function prediction in large genomes. As a result, the predictions of these algorithms are stored in static databases that can easily become outdated. We propose a new algorithm, GeneMANIA, that is as accurate as the leading methods, while capable of predicting protein function in real-time. RESULTS: We use a fast heuristic algorithm, derived from ridge regression, to integrate multiple functional association networks and predict gene function from a single process-specific network using label propagation. Our algorithm is efficient enough to be deployed on a modern webserver and is as accurate as, or more so than, the leading methods on the MouseFunc I benchmark and a new yeast function prediction benchmark; it is robust to redundant and irrelevant data and requires, on average, less than ten seconds of computation time on tasks from these benchmarks. CONCLUSION: GeneMANIA is fast enough to predict gene function on-the-fly while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. A prototype version of a GeneMANIA-based webserver is available at http://morrislab.med.utoronto.ca/prototype.},

Moreover, a number of recent studies have stressed the importance of cerebellar dysfunction in these same disorders. In the current study, we examined protein levels of the two GABA(B) receptor subunits GABBR1 and GABBR2 in lateral cerebella from a well-characterized cohort of subjects with schizophrenia (n=15), bipolar disorder (n=14), major depression (n=13) and healthy controls (n=12). We found significant reductions in protein for both GABBR1 and GABBR2 in lateral cerebella from subjects with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression when compared with controls. These results provide further evidence of GABAergic dysfunction in these three disorders as well as identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention.},

@article{Funk2012,
abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that schizophrenia may result from alterations of integration of signaling mediated by multiple neurotransmitter systems. Abnormalities of associated intracellular signaling pathways may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Proteins and phospho-proteins comprising mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and 3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-associated signaling pathways may be abnormally expressed in the anterior cingulate (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in schizophrenia. Using western blot analysis we examined proteins of the MAPK- and cAMP-associated pathways in these two brain regions. Postmortem samples were used from a well-characterized collection of elderly patients with schizophrenia (ACC=36, DLPFC=35) and a comparison (ACC=33, DLPFC=31) group. Near-infrared intensity of IR-dye labeled secondary antisera bound to targeted proteins of the MAPK- and cAMP-associated signaling pathways was measured using LiCor Odyssey imaging system. We found decreased expression of Rap2, JNK1, JNK2, PSD-95, and decreased phosphorylation of JNK1/2 at T183/Y185 and PSD-95 at S295 in the ACC in schizophrenia. In the DLPFC, we found increased expression of Rack1, Fyn, Cdk5, and increased phosphorylation of PSD-95 at S295 and NR2B at Y1336. MAPK- and cAMP-associated molecules constitute ubiquitous intracellular signaling pathways that integrate extracellular stimuli, modify receptor expression and function, and regulate cell survival and neuroplasticity. These data suggest abnormal activity of the MAPK- and cAMP-associated pathways in frontal cortical areas in schizophrenia. These alterations may underlie the hypothesized hypoglutamatergic function in this illness. Together with previous findings, these data suggest that abnormalities of intracellular signaling pathways may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: A critical task in high-throughput sequencing is aligning millions of short reads to a reference genome. Alignment is especially complicated for RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) because of RNA splicing. A number of RNA-Seq algorithms are available, and claim to align reads with high accuracy and efficiency while detecting splice junctions. RNA-Seq data are discrete in nature; therefore, with reasonable gene models and comparative metrics RNA-Seq data can be simulated to sufficient accuracy to enable meaningful benchmarking of alignment algorithms. The exercise to rigorously compare all viable published RNA-Seq algorithms has not been performed previously. RESULTS: We developed an RNA-Seq simulator that models the main impediments to RNA alignment, including alternative splicing, insertions, deletions, substitutions, sequencing errors and intron signal. We used this simulator to measure the accuracy and robustness of available algorithms at the base and junction levels. Additionally, we used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Sanger sequencing to validate the ability of the algorithms to detect novel transcript features such as novel exons and alternative splicing in RNA-Seq data from mouse retina. A pipeline based on BLAT was developed to explore the performance of established tools for this problem, and to compare it to the recently developed methods. This pipeline, the RNA-Seq Unified Mapper (RUM), performs comparably to the best current aligners and provides an advantageous combination of accuracy, speed and usability. AVAILABILITY: The RUM pipeline is distributed via the Amazon Cloud and for computing clusters using the Sun Grid Engine (http://cbil.upenn.edu/RUM). CONTACT: ggrant@pcbi.upenn.edu; epierce@mail.med.upenn.edu SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The RNA-Seq sequence reads described in the article are deposited at GEO, accession GSE26248.},

abstract = {It is well established that autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have a strong genetic component; however, for at least 70{\%} of cases, the underlying genetic cause is unknown. Under the hypothesis that de novo mutations underlie a substantial fraction of the risk for developing ASD in families with no previous history of ASD or related phenotypes--so-called sporadic or simplex families--we sequenced all coding regions of the genome (the exome) for parent-child trios exhibiting sporadic ASD, including 189 new trios and 20 that were previously reported. Additionally, we also sequenced the exomes of 50 unaffected siblings corresponding to these new (n = 31) and previously reported trios (n = 19), for a total of 677 individual exomes from 209 families. Here we show that de novo point mutations are overwhelmingly paternal in origin (4:1 bias) and positively correlated with paternal age, consistent with the modest increased risk for children of older fathers to develop ASD. Moreover, 39{\%} (49 of 126) of the most severe or disruptive de novo mutations map to a highly interconnected beta-catenin/chromatin remodelling protein network ranked significantly for autism candidate genes. In proband exomes, recurrent protein-altering mutations were observed in two genes: CHD8 and NTNG1. Mutation screening of six candidate genes in 1,703 ASD probands identified additional de novo, protein-altering mutations in GRIN2B, LAMC3 and SCN1A. Combined with copy number variant (CNV) data, these results indicate extreme locus heterogeneity but also provide a target for future discovery, diagnostics and therapeutics.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interstitial white matter neurons (IWMNs) may reflect immature neurons that migrate tangentially to the neocortex from the ganglionic eminence to form cortical interneurons. Alterations of interneuron markers have been detected in gray matter of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia, and IWMNs are also reported to be altered in schizophrenia. In this study, we considered whether a potential link exists between these two pathological findings. METHODS: From a cohort of 29 schizophrenia subjects and 37 control subjects, IWMN densities were determined in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex by counting neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN) and somatostatin (SST)-positive cells. Double-label immunofluorescence was carried out to determine the overlap between SST+/NeuN+ and SST+/neuropeptide Y + neurons. RESULTS: We found that density of NeuN + IWMNs in superficial white matter is significantly increased in schizophrenia subjects compared with control subjects. There was a significant negative correlation between SST mRNA expression in gray matter and NeuN + IWMN density. In schizophrenic patients with increased NeuN IWMN density, the density of SST-expressing neurons in white matter was also higher compared with control subjects. A subpopulation of SST immunopositive cells also show coexpression of neuropeptide Y. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed previous results indicating that the density of NeuN + IWMNs is increased in superficial white matter in schizophrenia. We provide the first evidence that increased IWMN density correlates with a gray matter interneuron deficit, suggesting that migration of interneurons from white matter to the cortex may be deficient in some patients with schizophrenia, consistent with an interneuron deficit in schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Recent research suggests that prenatal exposure to nonviral infection may be associated with increased risk of schizophrenia, and we hypothesized an association between maternal bacterial infection during pregnancy and elevated offspring risk of schizophrenia. Data on maternal infections from the Copenhagen Perinatal Cohort were linked with the Danish National Psychiatric Register. Offspring cases of narrowly defined schizophrenia (International Classification of Diseases, Eighth Revision [ICD-8]) and more broadly defined schizophrenia (ICD-8 and ICD-10) were identified before the ages of 32-34 and 45-47 years, respectively. The effect of prenatal exposure to bacterial infections was adjusted for prenatal exposure to analgesics and parental social status. In a risk set of 7941 individuals, 85 cases (1.1{\%}) of ICD-8 schizophrenia were identified by the age of 32-34 years and 153 cases (1.9{\%}) of more broadly defined schizophrenia by the age of 45-47 years. First-trimester exposure conferred an elevated risk of ICD-8 schizophrenia (odds ratio 2.53; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 1.07-5.96) and also of broadly defined schizophrenia (odds ratio 2.14; 95{\%} CI 1.06-4.31). Second-trimester exposure also conferred a significantly elevated risk of schizophrenia but only in unadjusted analyses. These findings suggest a relationship between maternal bacterial infection in pregnancy and offspring risk of schizophrenia, and this effect was somewhat stronger for ICD-8 schizophrenia with earlier onset. Post hoc analyses showed that upper respiratory tract and gonococcal infections were associated with elevated risk of the disease. An association between risk of schizophrenia and prenatal exposure to bacterial infections might be mediated through transplacental passage of maternally produced cytokines in response to bacterial infections.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Functional annotation of differentially expressed genes is a necessary and critical step in the analysis of microarray data. The distributed nature of biological knowledge frequently requires researchers to navigate through numerous web-accessible databases gathering information one gene at a time. A more judicious approach is to provide query-based access to an integrated database that disseminates biologically rich information across large datasets and displays graphic summaries of functional information. RESULTS: Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID; http://www.david.niaid.nih.gov) addresses this need via four web-based analysis modules: 1) Annotation Tool - rapidly appends descriptive data from several public databases to lists of genes; 2) GoCharts - assigns genes to Gene Ontology functional categories based on user selected classifications and term specificity level; 3) KeggCharts - assigns genes to KEGG metabolic processes and enables users to view genes in the context of biochemical pathway maps; and 4) DomainCharts - groups genes according to PFAM conserved protein domains. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis results and graphical displays remain dynamically linked to primary data and external data repositories, thereby furnishing in-depth as well as broad-based data coverage. The functionality provided by DAVID accelerates the analysis of genome-scale datasets by facilitating the transition from data collection to biological meaning.},

@article{Song2013,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The study was to examine the levels of adiponectin (APN) and other cytokines, and body metabolism in drug naive, first episode schizophrenia patients with normal weight. METHODS: Ninety-six drug naive, first episode schizophrenia patients with normal weight (SZ group), 60 healthy individuals with normal weight (control group), and 60 overweight or obese but otherwise healthy individuals (obesity group) were enrolled in the study. Serum levels of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and APN were measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Glucose oxidase was used to measure plasma glucose level. Lipid levels were measured using the enzymatic colorimetric method. RESULTS: Serum levels of IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha in both the SZ group and the obesity group were significantly higher than those in the control group (p's<0.001). There were no significant differences between the SZ group and the obesity group on those cytokines (p's>0.05). In addition, the levels of APN were significantly higher in the SZ group (p<0.001), and significantly lower in the obesity group (p<0.01) compared with the control group. Further, there were significant positive relationships between levels of APN and levels of other cytokines within the SZ group (p's<0.05); in contrast, there were significant negative relationships between levels of APN and levels of other cytokines within the obesity group (p's<0.05). Fasting serum levels of glucose, LDL, triglycerides and total cholesterol were significantly higher, and fasting serum levels of HDL were significantly lower in the obesity group compared with the other two groups (p's<0.01). There were no significant differences in any of the metabolic parameters between the control group and the SZ group (p's>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Drug naive, first episode schizophrenia patients with normal weight seem to present an up-regulated inflammatory status as reflected by elevated levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. APN may play a unique pro-inflammatory role in this patient population. Implications of the findings in relation to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and the vulnerability for metabolic problems were discussed.},

abstract = {Ultra-deep RNA sequencing has become a powerful approach for genome-wide analysis of pre-mRNA alternative splicing. We develop MATS (multivariate analysis of transcript splicing), a bayesian statistical framework for flexible hypothesis testing of differential alternative splicing patterns on RNA-Seq data. MATS uses a multivariate uniform prior to model the between-sample correlation in exon splicing patterns, and a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method coupled with a simulation-based adaptive sampling procedure to calculate the P-value and false discovery rate (FDR) of differential alternative splicing. Importantly, the MATS approach is applicable to almost any type of null hypotheses of interest, providing the flexibility to identify differential alternative splicing events that match a given user-defined pattern. We evaluated the performance of MATS using simulated and real RNA-Seq data sets. In the RNA-Seq analysis of alternative splicing events regulated by the epithelial-specific splicing factor ESRP1, we obtained a high RT-PCR validation rate of 86{\%} for differential exon skipping events with a MATS FDR of <10{\%}. Additionally, over the full list of RT-PCR tested exons, the MATS FDR estimates matched well with the experimental validation rate. Our results demonstrate that MATS is an effective and flexible approach for detecting differential alternative splicing from RNA-Seq data.},

abstract = {Deficits in prepulse inhibition (PPI) are a biological marker for psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. To unravel PPI-controlling mechanisms, we previously performed quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis in mice, and identified Fabp7, that encodes a brain-type fatty acid binding protein (Fabp), as a causative gene. In that study, human FABP7 showed genetic association with schizophrenia. FABPs constitute a gene family, of which members FABP5 and FABP3 are also expressed in the brain. These FABP proteins are molecular chaperons for polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acids. Additionally, the involvement of PUFAs has been documented in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and mood disorders. Therefore in this study, we examined the genetic roles of FABP5 and 3 in schizophrenia (N = 1,900 in combination with controls) and FABP7, 5, and 3 in bipolar disorder (N = 1,762 in the case-control set). Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from FABP7 showed nominal association with bipolar disorder, and haplotypes of the same gene showed empirical associations with bipolar disorder even after correction of multiple testing. We could not perform association studies on FABP5, due to the lack of informative SNPs. FABP3 displayed no association with either disease. Each FABP is relatively small and it is assumed that there are multiple regulatory elements that control gene expression. Therefore, future identification of unknown regulatory elements will be necessary to make a more detailed analysis of their genetic contribution to mental illnesses.},

abstract = {Microglia are crucial for immune responses in the brain. Although their origin from the yolk sac has been recognized for some time, their precise precursors and the transcription program that is used are not known. We found that mouse microglia were derived from primitive c-kit(+) erythromyeloid precursors that were detected in the yolk sac as early as 8 d post conception. These precursors developed into CD45(+) c-kit(lo) CX(3)CR1(-) immature (A1) cells and matured into CD45(+) c-kit(-) CX(3)CR1(+) (A2) cells, as evidenced by the downregulation of CD31 and concomitant upregulation of F4/80 and macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor (MCSF-R). Proliferating A2 cells became microglia and invaded the developing brain using specific matrix metalloproteinases. Notably, microgliogenesis was not only dependent on the transcription factor Pu.1 (also known as Sfpi), but also required Irf8, which was vital for the development of the A2 population, whereas Myb, Id2, Batf3 and Klf4 were not required. Our data provide cellular and molecular insights into the origin and development of microglia.},

abstract = {Phencyclidine is an N-methyl d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) blocker that has been reported to induce neuronal apoptosis during development and schizophrenia-like behaviors in rats later in life. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been shown to prevent neuronal death caused by NMDAR blockade, but the precise mechanism is unknown. This study examined the role of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways in BDNF protection of PCP-induced apoptosis in corticostriatal organotypic cultures. It was observed that BDNF inhibited PCP-induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent fashion. BDNF effectively prevented PCP-induced inhibition of the ERK and PI-3K/Akt pathways and suppressed GSK-3beta activation. Blockade of either PI-3K/Akt or ERK activation abolished BDNF protection. Western blot analysis revealed that the PI-3K inhibitor LY294002 prevented the stimulating effect of BDNF on the PI-3K/Akt pathway, but had no effect on the ERK pathway. Similarly, the ERK inhibitor PD98059 prevented the stimulating effect of BDNF on the ERK pathway, but not the PI-3K/Akt pathway. Co-application of LY294002 and PD98059 had no additional effect on BDNF-evoked activation of Akt or ERK. However, concurrent exposure to PD98059 and LY294002 caused much greater inhibition of BDNF-evoked phosphorylation of GSK-3beta at serine 9 than did LY294002 alone. Finally, either BDNF or GSK-3beta inhibition prevented PCP-induced suppression of cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation. These data demonstrate that the protective effect of BDNF against PCP-induced apoptosis is mediated by parallel activation of the PI-3K/Akt and ERK pathways, most likely involves inhibition of GSK-3beta and activation of CREB.},

abstract = {An excess of winter-spring births (and/or a decrease of summer births) has consistently been observed in schizophrenia (SCZ). This observation may provide a significant clue about the causes of the disease if specific factors which cause the phenomenon can be determined. This paper reviews several studies which investigated factors correlated with this observation in SCZ, in an attempt to determine which factors more likely cause the seasonality. Among the candidates of the factors are meteorological variables (such as ambient temperature), several infections, maternal hormones, sperm quality, nutrition and external toxins. A variation of procreation might also have an effect. Among the factors, the most extensively studied are temperature and viral infections. Some of them have appeared promising, but further studies are definitely required. Several challenges, including complicated correlations of the factors and determination of the susceptible period during pregnancy, need to be overcome. Comparisons of the data from areas and cohorts with different patterns of the candidate factors may be helpful. Animal studies may also help investigate the molecular and physiological mechanisms of the phenomenon.},

abstract = {Prenatal exposure to infection is a significant environmental risk factor in the development of schizophrenia and related disorders. Recent evidence indicates that disruption of functional and structural dopaminergic development may be at the core of the developmental neuropathology associated with psychosis-related abnormalities induced by prenatal exposure to infection. Using a mouse model of prenatal immune challenge by the viral mimic polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid, the present study critically evaluated this hypothesis by longitudinally monitoring the effects of maternal immune challenge during pregnancy on structural and functional dopaminergic development in the offspring from fetal to adult stages of life. Our study shows that prenatal immune challenge leads to dopaminergic maldevelopment starting as early as in the fetal stages of life and produces a set of postnatal dopaminergic abnormalities that is dependent on postnatal maturational processes. Furthermore, our longitudinal investigations reveal a striking developmental correspondence between the ontogeny of specific dopaminergic neuropathology and the postnatal onset of distinct forms of dopamine-dependent functional abnormalities implicated in schizophrenia. Prenatal immune activation thus appears to be a significant environmental risk factor for primary defects in normal dopaminergic development and facilitates the expression of postnatal dopamine dysfunctions involved in the precipitation of psychosis-related behavior. Early interventions targeting the developing dopamine system may open new avenues for a successful attenuation or even prevention of psychotic disorders following neurodevelopmental disruption of dopamine functions.},

@article{Kinney2010,
abstract = {We propose a unifying hypothesis of schizophrenia to help reconcile findings from many different disciplines. This hypothesis proposes that schizophrenia often involves pre- or perinatal exposure to adverse factors that produce a latent immune vulnerability. When this vulnerability is manifested, beginning around puberty with changes in immune function and involution of the thymus, individuals become more susceptible to infections and immune dysfunctions that contribute to schizophrenia. Our hypothesis suggests theoretical bridges between different lines of evidence on schizophrenia and offers explanations for many puzzling findings about schizophrenia. For example, the hypothesis helps account for why schizophrenia patients tend to have had increased exposure to neurotropic infections, but most individuals with such exposure do not develop schizophrenia, and why prenatal hardships increase risk for schizophrenia, but the onset of symptoms typically does not occur until after puberty. The hypothesis also explains another paradox: lower socioeconomic status and poor prenatal care increase risk for schizophrenia at the same geographic site, but international comparisons indicate that countries with higher per capita incomes and better prenatal care actually tend to have higher schizophrenia prevalences. As the hypothesis predicts, (1) prenatal adversity, which increases risk for schizophrenia, also impairs post-pubertal immune competence, (2) schizophrenia patients experience elevated morbidity from infectious and auto-immune diseases, (3) genetic and environmental risk factors for schizophrenia increase vulnerability to these diseases, (4) factors that exacerbate schizophrenic symptoms also tend to impair immune function, (5) many anti-psychotic medications combat infection, (6) effects of early infections may not appear until after puberty, when they can produce neurologic and psychiatric symptoms, and (7) immune dysfunctions, such as imbalances of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, may contribute to the onset of psychotic symptoms and the progressive loss of brain tissue in schizophrenia. The disruptive effects of prenatal adversity on the development of the immune system may often combine with adverse effects on prenatal brain development to produce schizophrenia. This paper focuses on the adverse immune system effects, because effects on the brain have been extensively discussed in neurodevelopmental theories of schizophrenia. We propose new tests of scientific predictions. We also point out potential clinical implications of the hypothesis; for example, individuals with schizophrenia may often have underlying infections or immune dysfunctions, such as imbalances in inflammatory cytokines, that contribute to the illness. This possibility could be tested experimentally--e.g., by clinical trials in which patients' exposure to infection is reduced or immune function is normalized.},

abstract = {Lactating females direct aggressive behaviors towards intruders presumably to reduce the likelihood of infanticide of their pups. Infected animals display a constellation of responses that include lethargy, anorexia, and decreased social interactions. This suite of responses is referred to as sickness behavior, and is putatively part of an adaptive strategy to aid the organism in recovery from infection. Previous work has suggested that animals can suppress the behavioral symptoms of sickness in order to engage in adaptive behaviors. To test whether adaptive nest defense is affected by illness, dams received a peripheral injection of either saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS [50, 400, or 1000 microg/kg]), a non-replicating component of bacterial cell walls that activates the immune system. Simulated infection with LPS reduced body mass and food intake in dams and interfered with litter growth in a dose-dependent manner. Generally, nest defense was unaffected by LPS; the proportion of dams displaying maternal aggression against a male intruder, as well as the latency and duration of aggressive encounters were only suppressed at the highest LPS dose tested. Further, LPS treatment also altered non-agonistic behavior during the aggression test as indicated by reduced social investigation of the intruder and an increased time spent immobile during the session. LPS administration also significantly increased serum corticosterone concentrations in lactating females. These findings suggest that maternal aggression is not suppressed by LPS-evoked immune activation at doses that attenuate other aspects of maternal and social behavior.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Amigo (Catheter Robotics, Inc., Mount Olive, NJ) remote catheter system (RCS) was designed to provide a simple and relatively inexpensive system for remote catheter manipulation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance and safety of Amigo in mapping the right side of the heart. METHODS AND RESULTS: This non-randomized, prospective clinical trial was conducted at 13 sites (NCT: {\#}01139814). Using the controller, a mapping catheter was moved to eight pre-specified locations in a specific sequence: right ventricular apex, mid-right ventricular septum, right ventricular outflow tract, His-bundle position, coronary sinus ostium, high right atrium, lateral tricuspid annulus, and low lateral right atrium. The pre-specified efficacy endpoint was to achieve 80 {\%} successful navigation to all locations. Time to each location, location accuracy, and quality of contact were confirmed by imaging and specific criteria for electrograms and pacing thresholds. In 181 patients, a total of 1,396 of 1,448 (96 {\%}) locations were successfully mapped with all protocol criteria met (one-sided p value < 0.0001). The median time to move the catheter to a new location was 24 s. The Amigo-related major complication rate was 0 {\%} which was significantly less than the predefined endpoint of 4 {\%} (one-sided p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: We found the Amigo RCS to be safe and effective for positioning a mapping catheter at sites within the right atrium and ventricle.},

The level of this parameter was higher in patients before treatment vs. healthy controls; after therapy with olanzapine this level decreased and did not differ from that of controls. The functional activity of immunocompetent cells (the phagocyte activity of neutrophiles and monocytes, the cytotoxic activity of natural killer lymphocytes, interleukin-2, and interleukin-10 production) did not depend on the clinical condition of the patients and the therapy and was significantly lower than that of controls both before and during the treatment. Attention should be paid to the fact that the level of IL-1beta production in schizophrenia patients did not differ from that of controls. After eight weeks of therapy the level of IL-1beta production increased significantly in all groups of patients and was significantly higher than that of controls during the whole observation period irrespectively of sex and patients' response to the therapy.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Gene expression class comparison studies may identify hundreds or thousands of genes as differentially expressed (DE) between sample groups. Gaining biological insight from the result of such experiments can be approached, for instance, by identifying the signaling pathways impacted by the observed changes. Most of the existing pathway analysis methods focus on either the number of DE genes observed in a given pathway (enrichment analysis methods), or on the correlation between the pathway genes and the class of the samples (functional class scoring methods). Both approaches treat the pathways as simple sets of genes, disregarding the complex gene interactions that these pathways are built to describe. RESULTS: We describe a novel signaling pathway impact analysis (SPIA) that combines the evidence obtained from the classical enrichment analysis with a novel type of evidence, which measures the actual perturbation on a given pathway under a given condition. A bootstrap procedure is used to assess the significance of the observed total pathway perturbation. Using simulations we show that the evidence derived from perturbations is independent of the pathway enrichment evidence. This allows us to calculate a global pathway significance P-value, which combines the enrichment and perturbation P-values. We illustrate the capabilities of the novel method on four real datasets. The results obtained on these data show that SPIA has better specificity and more sensitivity than several widely used pathway analysis methods. AVAILABILITY: SPIA was implemented as an R package available at http://vortex.cs.wayne.edu/ontoexpress/},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We tested the hypothesis that maternal infections during pregnancy are associated with the subsequent development of schizophrenia and other psychoses in adulthood. METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study of 27 adults with schizophrenia and other psychotic illnesses and 54 matched unaffected control subjects (matched for sex, ethnicity, and date of birth) from the Providence, RI, cohort of the Collaborative Perinatal Project. We retrieved stored blood samples that had been obtained from these mothers at the end of pregnancy. These samples were analyzed for total class-specific immunoglobulins and for specific antibodies directed at recognized perinatal pathogens capable of affecting brain development. RESULTS: Maternal levels of IgG and IgM class immunoglobulins before the mothers were delivered of their neonates were significantly elevated among the case series (t = 3.06, P =.003; t = 2.93, P =.004, respectively, for IgG and IgM immunoglobulin-albumin ratios). Secondary analyses indicated a significant association between maternal antibodies to herpes simplex virus type 2 glycoprotein gG2 and subsequent psychotic illness (matched t test = 2.43, P =.02). We did not find significant differences between case and control mothers in the serum levels of IgA class immunoglobulins, or in specific IgG antibodies to herpes simplex virus type 1, cytomegalovirus, Toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus, human parvovirus B19, Chlamydia trachomatis, or human papillomavirus type 16. CONCLUSIONS: The offspring of mothers with elevated levels of total IgG and IgM immunoglobulins and antibodies to herpes simplex virus type 2 are at increased risk for the development of schizophrenia and other psychotic illnesses in adulthood.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia is an idiopathic mental disorder with a heritable component and a substantial public health impact. We conducted a multi-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) for schizophrenia beginning with a Swedish national sample (5,001 cases and 6,243 controls) followed by meta-analysis with previous schizophrenia GWAS (8,832 cases and 12,067 controls) and finally by replication of SNPs in 168 genomic regions in independent samples (7,413 cases, 19,762 controls and 581 parent-offspring trios). We identified 22 loci associated at genome-wide significance; 13 of these are new, and 1 was previously implicated in bipolar disorder. Examination of candidate genes at these loci suggests the involvement of neuronal calcium signaling. We estimate that 8,300 independent, mostly common SNPs (95{\%} credible interval of 6,300-10,200 SNPs) contribute to risk for schizophrenia and that these collectively account for at least 32{\%} of the variance in liability. Common genetic variation has an important role in the etiology of schizophrenia, and larger studies will allow more detailed understanding of this disorder.},

abstract = {Myelin abnormalities that reflect damage to developing and mature brains are often found in neurological diseases with evidence of inflammatory infiltration and microglial activation. Many cytokines are virtually undetectable in the uninflamed central nervous system (CNS), so that their rapid induction and sustained elevation in immune and glial cells contributes to dysregulation of the inflammatory response and neural cell homeostasis. This results in aberrant neural cell development, cytotoxicity, and loss of the primary myelin-producing cells of the CNS, the oligodendrocytes. This article provides an overview of cytokine and chemokine activity in the CNS with relevance to clinical conditions of neonatal and adult demyelinating disease, brain trauma, and mental disorders with observed white matter defects. Experimental models that mimic human disease have been developed in order to study pathogenic and therapeutic mechanisms, but have shown mixed success in clinical application. However, genetically altered animals, and models of CNS inflammation and demyelination, have offered great insight into the complexities of neuroimmune interactions that impact oligodendrocyte function. The intracellular signaling pathways of selected cytokines have also been highlighted to illustrate current knowledge of receptor-mediated events. By learning to interpret the actions of cytokines and by improving methods to target appropriate predictors of disease risk selectively, a more comprehensive understanding of altered immunoregulation will aid in the development of advanced treatment options for patients with inflammatory white matter disorders.},

abstract = {Hypoxia is an essential developmental and physiological stimulus that plays a key role in the pathophysiology of cancer, heart attack, stroke, and other major causes of mortality. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is the only known mammalian transcription factor expressed uniquely in response to physiologically relevant levels of hypoxia. We now report that in Hif1a-/- embryonic stem cells that did not express the O2-regulated HIF-1alpha subunit, levels of mRNAs encoding glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes were reduced, and cellular proliferation was impaired. Vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA expression was also markedly decreased in hypoxic Hif1a-/- embryonic stem cells and cystic embryoid bodies. Complete deficiency of HIF-1alpha resulted in developmental arrest and lethality by E11 of Hif1a-/- embryos that manifested neural tube defects, cardiovascular malformations, and marked cell death within the cephalic mesenchyme. In Hif1a+/+ embryos, HIF-1alpha expression increased between E8.5 and E9.5, coincident with the onset of developmental defects and cell death in Hif1a-/- embryos. These results demonstrate that HIF-1alpha is a master regulator of cellular and developmental O2 homeostasis.},

Recently, this concept has been challenged by the results of developmental and gene expression profiling studies that have used novel molecular biological tools to unravel the origin of microglia and to define their role as specialized tissue macrophages with long lifespans. Here, we describe how these results have redefined microglia and helped us to understand how different myeloid cell populations operate in the CNS based on their cell-specific gene expression signatures, distinct ontogeny and differential functions. Moreover, we describe the vulnerability of microglia to dysfunction and propose that myelomonocytic cells might be used in the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders that are characterized by primary or secondary 'microgliopathy'.},

abstract = {Developing reliable, predictive animal models for complex psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, is essential to increase our understanding of the neurobiological basis of the disorder and for the development of novel drugs with improved therapeutic efficacy. All available animal models of schizophrenia fit into four different induction categories: developmental, drug-induced, lesion or genetic manipulation, and the best characterized examples of each type are reviewed herein. Most rodent models have behavioural phenotype changes that resemble 'positive-like' symptoms of schizophrenia, probably reflecting altered mesolimbic dopamine function, but fewer models also show altered social interaction, and learning and memory impairment, analogous to negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia respectively. The negative and cognitive impairments in schizophrenia are resistant to treatment with current antipsychotics, even after remission of the psychosis, which limits their therapeutic efficacy. The MATRICS initiative developed a consensus on the core cognitive deficits of schizophrenic patients, and recommended a standardized test battery to evaluate them. More recently, work has begun to identify specific rodent behavioural tasks with translational relevance to specific cognitive domains affected in schizophrenia, and where available this review focuses on reporting the effect of current and potential antipsychotics on these tasks. The review also highlights the need to develop more comprehensive animal models that more adequately replicate deficits in negative and cognitive symptoms. Increasing information on the neurochemical and structural CNS changes accompanying each model will also help assess treatments that prevent the development of schizophrenia rather than treating the symptoms, another pivotal change required to enable new more effective therapeutic strategies to be developed.},

This mutation is predicted to cause three-dimensional structure changes of DES. Immunohistological and electron microscopy studies demonstrated diffuse abnormal DES aggregations in DCM-induced-pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes, and control-iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes transduced with A285V-DES. DCM-iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes also exhibited functional abnormalities in vitro. This is the first demonstration that patient-specific iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes can be used to provide histological and functional confirmation of a suspected genetic basis for DCM identified by WES.},

abstract = {An increased incidence of anxiety, depression and attention deficits in children has been linked to psychological stress during pregnancy. Subjection of a pregnant rat to stress at a time when the foetal limbic and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axes develop results in anxiogenic and depressive behaviour and learning and attention deficits in the offspring, which depend on its gender, intensity and timing of the maternal stress and behaviour being tested. Maternal stress increases corticosterone levels in the foetal brain, decreases foetal testosterone and brain aromatase activity in males, and alters brain catecholamine activity to that in females. Learning deficits, reductions in hippocampal neurogenesis, LTP and dendritic spine density in the prefrontal cortex are more readily seen in prenatally-stressed males, while anxiety, depression and increased response of the HPA axis to stress are more prevalent in females. Genders may differ in the sensitivity of developing brain areas to stress hormones.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have achieved unprecedented success in the identification of novel genes and pathways implicated in complex traits. Typically, studies for disease use a case-control (CC) design and studies for quantitative traits (QT) are population based. The question that we address is what is the equivalence between CC and QT association studies in terms of detection power and sample size? We compare the binary and continuous traits by assuming a threshold model for disease and assuming that the effect size on disease liability has similar feature as on QT. We derive the approximate ratio of the non-centrality parameter (NCP) between CC and QT association studies, which is determined by sample size, disease prevalence (K) and the proportion of cases (v) in the CC study. For disease with prevalence <0.1, CC association study with equal numbers of cases and controls (v=0.5) needs smaller sample size than QT association study to achieve equivalent power, e.g. a CC association study of schizophrenia (K=0.01) needs only approximately 55{\%} sample size required for association study of height. So a planned meta-analysis for height on approximately 120,000 individuals has power equivalent to a CC study on 33,100 schizophrenia cases and 33,100 controls, a size not yet achievable for this disease. With equal sample size, when v=K, the power of CC association study is much less than that of QT association study because of the information lost by transforming a quantitative continuous trait to a binary trait.},

Instead of being predominantly detrimental cells showing a stereotypic activation pattern, microglia today are considered highly adaptive elements with many distinct phenotypes. Microglia activity is aimed to protect and to restore and only in case of uncontrolled or impaired microglia function these cells may have detrimental effects. The control of microglia activity is thus an important issue to understand. The family of chemokines are versatile signals specialized to control cell-cell interactions. Neurons express chemokines in a temporarily and spatially regulated manner and microglia respond to these messengers via the appropriate receptors. Due to these features are chemokines ideal messengers for the communication between neurons and microglia.},

abstract = {Recent molecular genetics studies implicate neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and its receptor erbB in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Among NRG1 receptors, erbB4 is of particular interest because of its crucial roles in neurodevelopment and in the modulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor signaling. Here, using a new postmortem tissue-stimulation approach, we show a marked increase in NRG1-induced activation of erbB4 in the prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia. Levels of NRG1 and erbB4, however, did not differ between schizophrenia and control groups. To evaluate possible causes for this hyperactivation of erbB4 signaling, we examined the association of erbB4 with PSD-95 (postsynaptic density protein of 95 kDa), as this association has been shown to facilitate activation of erbB4. Schizophrenia subjects showed substantial increases in erbB4-PSD-95 interactions. We found that NRG1 stimulation suppresses NMDA receptor activation in the human prefrontal cortex, as previously reported in the rodent cortex. NRG1-induced suppression of NMDA receptor activation was more pronounced in schizophrenia subjects than in controls, consistent with enhanced NRG1-erbB4 signaling seen in this illness. Therefore, these findings suggest that enhanced NRG1 signaling may contribute to NMDA hypofunction in schizophrenia.},

abstract = {The Rho GTPase RhoB has been shown to affect cell migration, but how it does this is not clear. Here we show that cells depleted of RhoB by RNAi are rounded and have defects in Rac-mediated spreading and lamellipodium extension, although they have active membrane ruffling around the periphery. Depletion of the exchange factor GEF-H1 induces a similar phenotype. RhoB-depleted cells migrate faster, but less persistently in a chemotactic gradient, and frequently round up during migration. RhoB-depleted cells have similar numbers of focal adhesions to control cells during spreading and migration, but show more diffuse and patchy contact with the substratum. They have lower levels of surface beta1 integrin, and beta1 integrin activity is reduced in actin-rich protrusions. We propose that RhoB contributes to directional cell migration by regulating beta1 integrin surface levels and activity, thereby stabilizing lamellipodial protrusions.},

These parameters must be estimated by fitting the model to experimental data. This estimation problem is very challenging due to the non-linear character of the dynamics, the large number of parameters and the frequently poor information content of the experimental data (poor practical identifiability).

abstract = {Current genome-wide association studies (GWAS) use commercial genotyping microarrays that can assay over a million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The number of SNPs is further boosted by advanced statistical genotype-imputation algorithms and large SNP databases for reference human populations. The testing of a huge number of SNPs needs to be taken into account in the interpretation of statistical significance in such genome-wide studies, but this is complicated by the non-independence of SNPs because of linkage disequilibrium (LD). Several previous groups have proposed the use of the effective number of independent markers (M(e)) for the adjustment of multiple testing, but current methods of calculation for M(e) are limited in accuracy or computational speed. Here, we report a more robust and fast method to calculate M(e). Applying this efficient method [implemented in a free software tool named Genetic type 1 error calculator (GEC)], we systematically examined the M(e), and the corresponding p-value thresholds required to control the genome-wide type 1 error rate at 0.05, for 13 Illumina or Affymetrix genotyping arrays, as well as for HapMap Project and 1000 Genomes Project datasets which are widely used in genotype imputation as reference panels. Our results suggested the use of a p-value threshold of {\~{}}10(-7) as the criterion for genome-wide significance for early commercial genotyping arrays, but slightly more stringent p-value thresholds {\~{}}5 × 10(-8) for current or merged commercial genotyping arrays, {\~{}}10(-8) for all common SNPs in the 1000 Genomes Project dataset and {\~{}}5 × 10(-8) for the common SNPs only within genes.},

abstract = {The impact of the group B streptococcus (GBS)-induced maternal inflammation on offspring's brain has not yet been investigated despite GBS being one of the most frequent bacteria colonizing or infecting pregnant women. According to our hypothesis GBS-induced maternal immune activation plays a role in offspring perinatal brain damage and subsequent neurodisabilities such as autism. Using a new preclinical rat model of maternal inflammation triggered by inactivated GBS, we demonstrated placental, neuropathological and behavioral impacts on offspring. GBS-exposed placentas presented cystic lesions and polymorphonuclear infiltration located within the decidual/maternal side of the placenta, contrasting with macrophagic infiltration and necrotic areas located in the labyrinth/fetal compartment of the placenta after lipopolysaccharide-induced maternal inflammation. Brain damage featured lateral ventricles widening, predominately in the male, reduction of periventricular external capsules thickness, oligodendrocyte loss, and disorganization of frontoparietal subcortical tissue with no glial proliferation. Autistic hallmarks were found in offspring exposed to GBS, namely deficits in motor behavior, social and communicative impairments, i.e. profound defects in the integration and response to both acoustic and chemical signals that are predominant modes of communication in rats. Surprisingly, only male offspring were affected by these combined autistic-like traits. Our results show for the first time that materno-fetal inflammatory response to GBS plays a role in the induction of placental and cerebral insults, remarkably recapitulating cardinal features of human autism such as gender dichotomy and neurobehavioral traits. Unlike other models of prenatal inflammatory brain damage (induced by viral/toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) or Gram-negative/TLR4), maternal inflammation resulting from GBS/TLR2 interactions induced a distinctive pattern of chorioamnionitis and cerebral injuries. These results also provide important evidence that beyond genetic influences, modifiable environmental factors play a role in both the occurrence of autism and its gender imbalance.},

abstract = {The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia has been one of the most enduring ideas in psychiatry. Initially, the emphasis was on a role of hyperdopaminergia in the etiology of schizophrenia (version I), but it was subsequently reconceptualized to specify subcortical hyperdopaminergia with prefrontal hypodopaminergia (version II). However, these hypotheses focused too narrowly on dopamine itself, conflated psychosis and schizophrenia, and predated advances in the genetics, molecular biology, and imaging research in schizophrenia. Since version II, there have been over 6700 articles about dopamine and schizophrenia. We selectively review these data to provide an overview of the 5 critical streams of new evidence: neurochemical imaging studies, genetic evidence, findings on environmental risk factors, research into the extended phenotype, and animal studies. We synthesize this evidence into a new dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia-version III: the final common pathway. This hypothesis seeks to be comprehensive in providing a framework that links risk factors, including pregnancy and obstetric complications, stress and trauma, drug use, and genes, to increased presynaptic striatal dopaminergic function. It explains how a complex array of pathological, positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and other findings, such as frontotemporal structural and functional abnormalities and cognitive impairments, may converge neurochemically to cause psychosis through aberrant salience and lead to a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The hypothesis has one major implication for treatment approaches. Current treatments are acting downstream of the critical neurotransmitter abnormality. Future drug development and research into etiopathogenesis should focus on identifying and manipulating the upstream factors that converge on the dopaminergic funnel point.},

abstract = {TH (tyrosine hydroxylase) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of catecholamines. The cat-2 gene of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is expressed in mechanosensory dopaminergic neurons and has been proposed to encode a putative TH. In the present paper, we report the cloning of C. elegans full-length cat-2 cDNA and a detailed biochemical characterization of the encoded CAT-2 protein. Similar to other THs, C. elegans CAT-2 is composed of an N-terminal regulatory domain followed by a catalytic domain and a C-terminal oligomerization domain and shows high substrate specificity for L-tyrosine. Like hTH (human TH), CAT-2 is tetrameric and is phosphorylated at Ser35 (equivalent to Ser40 in hTH) by PKA (cAMP-dependent protein kinase). However, CAT-2 is devoid of characteristic regulatory mechanisms present in hTH, such as negative co-operativity for the cofactor, substrate inhibition or feedback inhibition exerted by catecholamines, end-products of the pathway. Thus TH activity in C. elegans displays a weaker regulation in comparison with the human orthologue, resembling a constitutively active enzyme. Overall, our data suggest that the intricate regulation characteristic of mammalian TH might have evolved from more simple models to adjust to the increasing complexity of the higher eukaryotes neuroendocrine systems.},

abstract = {The development of mesencephalic catecholaminergic neurons in the embryonic and fetal mouse was analysed in tissues fixed with 5{\%} acrolein using polyclonal rabbit antibodies against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the first enzyme in catecholamine synthesis. The first TH positive cells were identified as early as day 8.5-9 of gestation and some expressed TH while apparently still migrating from the proliferative layer. The number of catecholamine cells increased dramatically by embryonic day 9.5-10; at gestation days 10.5-11 numerous TH positive cells bearing many neurites were localized in the ventral part of the mesencephalon but they were not yet separated into two different groups (A9 and A10). After 13 days of gestation two separate catecholaminergic groups could be visualized, although many TH positive cells with long neurites (putative dopaminergic neurons) could still be seen at the edges of the ventricle, and appeared to be moving towards the ventral mesencephalon. On the basis of these results the possibility that catecholamine cells that are produced early during the development of the midbrain may have neurotrophic and/or morphogenetic roles is discussed.},

abstract = {In the mature brain, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) functions primarily as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. But it can also act as a trophic factor during nervous system development to influence events such as proliferation, migration, differentiation, synapse maturation and cell death. GABA mediates these processes by the activation of traditional ionotropic and metabotropic receptors, and probably by both synaptic and non-synaptic mechanisms. However, the functional properties of GABA receptor signalling in the immature brain are significantly different from, and in some ways opposite to, those found in the adult brain. The unique features of the early-appearing GABA signalling systems might help to explain how GABA acts as a developmental signal.},

abstract = {Immune alterations in schizophrenia have been described for decades. Modern immunological methods and new insights into the highly developed and functionally differentiated immune system allow an integrative view of both the older and the recent findings of immunological abnormalities in schizophrenia. Both the unspecific and the specific arms of the immune system seem to be involved in the dysfunction of the immune system in schizophrenia. The unspecific, "innate" immune system shows signs of overactivation in unmedicated schizophrenic patients, as indicated by increased monocytes and gamma delta-cells. Increased levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the activation of the IL-6 system in schizophrenia might be the result of the activation of monocytes/macrophages, too. On the other hand, several parameters of the specific cellular immune system are blunted, such as, for example, the decreased T helper-1 (TH-1)-related immune parameters in schizophrenic patients both in vitro and in vivo. It seems that a TH-1-TH-2 imbalance with a shift to the TH-2 system is associated with schizophrenia. During antipsychotic therapy with neuroleptics, the specific TH-1-related immune answer becomes activated, but in addition the B cell system and antibody production increase.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Susceptibility to viral infections as well as their severity are higher in men than in women. Heightened antiviral responses typical of women are effective for rapid virus clearance, but if excessively high or prolonged, can result in chronic/inflammatory pathologies. We investigated whether this variability could be in part attributable to differences in the response to the Toll-Like Receptors (TLR) more involved in the virus recognition. METHODS: Cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from male and female healthy donors after stimulation with Toll-like receptors (TLR) 3, 7, 8, 9 ligands or with viruses (influenza and Herpes-simplex-1) was evaluated. RESULTS: Compared to females, PBMCs from males produced not only lower amounts of IFN-alpha in response to TLR7 ligands but also higher amounts of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL10 after stimulation with TLR8 and TLR9 ligands or viruses. IL10 production after TLR9 ligands or HSV-1 stimulation was significantly related with plasma levels of sex hormones in both groups, whereas no correlation was found in cytokines produced following TLR7 and TLR8 stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: Given the role of an early production of IL10 by cells of innate immunity in modulating innate and adaptive immune response to viruses, we suggest that sex-related difference in its production following viral nucleic acid stimulation of TLRs may be involved in the sex-related variability in response to viral infections.},

abstract = {This systematic review summarizes and critically appraises the literature on the effect of erythropoietin (EPO) in schizophrenia patients and the pathophysiological mechanisms that may explain the potential of its use in this disease. EPO is mainly known for its regulatory activity in the synthesis of erythrocytes and is frequently used in treatment of chronic anemia. This cytokine, however, has many other properties, some of which may improve the symptoms of psychiatric illness. The review follows the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement guidelines. Three databases (Medline, Web of Science, and Cochrane) were searched combining the search terms 'erythropoietin AND (psychotic disorders OR schizophrenia)'. Seventy-eight studies were included in qualitative synthesis, a meta-analytic approach being prohibited. The findings suggest that several EPO cerebral potential properties may be relevant for schizophrenia treatment, such as neurotransmission regulation, neuroprotection, modulation of inflammation, effects on blood-brain barrier permeability, effects on oxidative stress and neurogenesis. Several potentially detrimental side-effects of EPO therapy, such as increased risk of thrombosis, cancer, increased metabolic rate and mean arterial blood pressure leading to cerebral ischemia could severely limit or halt the use of EPO. Overall, because the available data are inconclusive, further efforts in this field are warranted.},

abstract = {The protective/neurotoxic role of fractalkine (CX3CL1) and its receptor CX3C chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1) signaling in neurodegenerative disease is an intricate and highly debated research topic and it is becoming even more complicated as new studies reveal discordant results. It appears that the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 axis plays a direct role in neurodegeneration and/or neuroprotection depending on the CNS insult. However, all the above studies focused on the role of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling in pathological conditions, ignoring the relevance of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling under physiological conditions. No approach to date has been taken to decipher the significance of defects in CX3CL1/CX3CR1 signaling in physiological condition. In the present study we used CX3CR1(-)/(-), CX3CR1(+)/(-), and wild-type mice to investigate the physiological role of CX3CR1 receptor in cognition and synaptic plasticity. Our results demonstrate for the first time that mice lacking the CX3CR1 receptor show contextual fear conditioning and Morris water maze deficits. CX3CR1 deficiency also affects motor learning. Importantly, mice lacking the receptor have a significant impairment in long-term potentiation (LTP). Infusion with IL-1beta receptor antagonist significantly reversed the deficit in cognitive function and impairment in LTP. Our results reveal that under physiological conditions, disruption in CX3CL1 signaling will lead to impairment in cognitive function and synaptic plasticity via increased action of IL-1beta.},

@article{Torrey1996,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: More than 40 studies have been done on seasonal birth patterns for schizophrenia, but only two small studies have been done for DSM-III-R bipolar disorder and none for schizoaffective disorder. Two studies have also reported a significant relationship between schizophrenia births and stillbirths. METHODS: In the largest study to date, birth data from four states was obtained on 126,987 state psychiatric hospitals inpatients divided into 'process' schizophrenia (disorganized, catatonic, undifferentiated), paranoid schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder and major depression. Time series analysis compared these births to all general births and to stillbirths. RESULTS: 'Process' schizophrenia, paranoid schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder all had statistically significant seasonal excess births from December through March (p = 0.0000). The largest excess was 5.8{\%} for bipolar disorder. Major depression had significant excess births from March through May. Time series analysis showed statistically significant coherences between major depression and bipolar disorder (0.995) and between schizoaffective disorder and both 'process' schizophrenia (0.977) and bipolar disorder (0.977). Unexpectedly, a significant coherence was also found between paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (0.972). Excess stillbirths were found for each month from January through June and a significant coherence was found between stillbirths and paranoid schizophrenia (0.998). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that DSM-III-R bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorder both have an excess of winter births, similar to that found in schizophrenia. Time series analysis, however, suggests that the causes may not be identical. Major depression, by contrast, has an excess of spring births.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia is one of the most detrimental common psychiatric disorders, occurring at a prevalence of approximately 1{\%}, and characterized by increased mortality and reduced reproduction, especially in men. The heritability has been estimated around 70{\%} and the genome-wide association meta-analyses conducted by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium have been successful at identifying an increasing number of risk loci. Various theories have been proposed to explain why genetic variants that predispose to schizophrenia persist in the population, despite the fitness reduction in affected individuals, a question known as the evolutionary paradox. In this review, we consider evolutionary perspectives of schizophrenia and of the empirical evidence that may support these perspectives. Proposed evolutionary explanations include balancing selection, fitness trade-offs, fluctuating environments, sexual selection, mutation-selection balance and genomic conflicts. We address the expectations about the genetic architecture of schizophrenia that are predicted by different evolutionary scenarios and discuss the implications for genetic studies. Several potential sources of "missing" heritability, including gene-environment interactions, epigenetic variation, and rare genetic variation are examined from an evolutionary perspective. A better understanding of evolutionary history may provide valuable clues to the genetic architecture of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders, which is highly relevant to genetic studies that aim to detect genetic risk variants.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: While genome-wide association studies identified some promising candidates for schizophrenia, the majority of risk genes remained unknown. We were interested in testing whether integration gene expression and other functional information could facilitate the identification of susceptibility genes and related biological pathways. RESULTS: We conducted high throughput sequencing analyses to evaluate mRNA expression in blood samples isolated from 3 schizophrenia patients and 3 healthy controls. We also conducted pooled sequencing of 10 schizophrenic patients and matched controls. Differentially expressed genes were identified by t-test. In the individually sequenced dataset, we identified 198 genes differentially expressed between cases and controls, of them 19 had been verified by the pooled sequencing dataset and 21 reached nominal significance in gene-based association analyses of a genome wide association dataset. Pathway analysis of these differentially expressed genes revealed that they were highly enriched in the immune related pathways. Two genes, S100A8 and TYROBP, had consistent changes in expression in both individual and pooled sequencing datasets and were nominally significant in gene-based association analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Integration of gene expression and pathway analyses with genome-wide association may be an efficient approach to identify risk genes for schizophrenia.},

@article{Asada1997,
abstract = {In addition to its role as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is presumed to be involved in the development and plasticity of the nervous system. GABA is synthesized by glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), but the respective roles of its two isoforms (GAD65 and 67) have not been determined. The selective elimination of each GAD isoform by gene targeting is expected to clarify these issues. Recently we have produced GAD65 -/- mice and demonstrated that lack of GAD65 does not change brain GABA contents or animal behavior, except for a slight increase in susceptibility to seizures. Here we report the production of GAD67 -/- mice. These mice were born at the expected frequency but died of severe cleft palate during the first morning after birth. GAD activities and GABA contents were reduced to 20{\%} and 7{\%}, respectively, in the cerebral cortex of the newborn GAD67 -/- mice. Their brain, however, did not show any discernible defects. Previous pharmacological and genetic investigations have suggested the involvement of GABA in palate formation, but this is the first demonstration of a role for GAD67-derived GABA in the development of nonneural tissue.},

@article{Eden2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since the inception of the GO annotation project, a variety of tools have been developed that support exploring and searching the GO database. In particular, a variety of tools that perform GO enrichment analysis are currently available. Most of these tools require as input a target set of genes and a background set and seek enrichment in the target set compared to the background set. A few tools also exist that support analyzing ranked lists. The latter typically rely on simulations or on union-bound correction for assigning statistical significance to the results. RESULTS: GOrilla is a web-based application that identifies enriched GO terms in ranked lists of genes, without requiring the user to provide explicit target and background sets. This is particularly useful in many typical cases where genomic data may be naturally represented as a ranked list of genes (e.g. by level of expression or of differential expression). GOrilla employs a flexible threshold statistical approach to discover GO terms that are significantly enriched at the top of a ranked gene list. Building on a complete theoretical characterization of the underlying distribution, called mHG, GOrilla computes an exact p-value for the observed enrichment, taking threshold multiple testing into account without the need for simulations. This enables rigorous statistical analysis of thousand of genes and thousands of GO terms in order of seconds. The output of the enrichment analysis is visualized as a hierarchical structure, providing a clear view of the relations between enriched GO terms. CONCLUSION: GOrilla is an efficient GO analysis tool with unique features that make a useful addition to the existing repertoire of GO enrichment tools. GOrilla's unique features and advantages over other threshold free enrichment tools include rigorous statistics, fast running time and an effective graphical representation. GOrilla is publicly available at: http://cbl-gorilla.cs.technion.ac.il},

Another advanced line ('OH416'), with 'Amigo' in its pedigree, was examined for the presence of the 'Amigo,' 1RS/1AL translocation. Only two satellited chromosomes were observed in most mitotic root-tip cells from 'GR876,' 'OH413,' and 'OH414,' compared to four in most cells from 'OH416.' Heteromorphic bivalents were observed in most PMCs from hybrids produced by crossing 'GR876,' 'OH413,' and 'OH414' as females to 'Chinese Spring.' No heteromorphic bivalents were observed in PMCs from 'OH416' x 'Chinese Spring' hybrids. When 'GR876' and the Ohio lines were hybridized with 'Chinese Spring' dimonotelosomic-1B, telosomic trivalents, consisting of the short- and longarm telosomes paired with chromosome 1B, were only observed in PMCs from 43-chromosome hybrids involving 'OH416.' The long-arm telosome paired with the translocation chromosome, while the short-arm telosome remained unpaired in all other 43-chromosome hybrids. Separation of gliadin proteins from 'GR876' and the Ohio lines by PAGE revealed that secalin bands for 'GR876,' 'OH413,' and 'OH414,' migrated similarly to the secalins for 'Kavkaz.' Bands for 'OH416,' identified as possible secalins, migrated similarly to those for 'Amigo.' Cultivar 'GR876' and advanced Ohio soft red winter wheat lines 'OH413' and 'OH414' carry the 'Kavkaz' translocation, while 'OH416' carries the 'Amigo' translocation.},

abstract = {The identification of untranslated regions, introns, and coding regions within an organism remains challenging. We developed a quantitative sequencing-based method called RNA-Seq for mapping transcribed regions, in which complementary DNA fragments are subjected to high-throughput sequencing and mapped to the genome. We applied RNA-Seq to generate a high-resolution transcriptome map of the yeast genome and demonstrated that most (74.5{\%}) of the nonrepetitive sequence of the yeast genome is transcribed. We confirmed many known and predicted introns and demonstrated that others are not actively used. Alternative initiation codons and upstream open reading frames also were identified for many yeast genes. We also found unexpected 3'-end heterogeneity and the presence of many overlapping genes. These results indicate that the yeast transcriptome is more complex than previously appreciated.},

abstract = {Mutations in the X-linked MECP2 gene, which encodes the transcriptional regulator methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), cause Rett syndrome and several neurodevelopmental disorders including cognitive disorders, autism, juvenile-onset schizophrenia and encephalopathy with early lethality. Rett syndrome is characterized by apparently normal early development followed by regression, motor abnormalities, seizures and features of autism, especially stereotyped behaviours. The mechanisms mediating these features are poorly understood. Here we show that mice lacking Mecp2 from GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-releasing neurons recapitulate numerous Rett syndrome and autistic features, including repetitive behaviours. Loss of MeCP2 from a subset of forebrain GABAergic neurons also recapitulates many features of Rett syndrome. MeCP2-deficient GABAergic neurons show reduced inhibitory quantal size, consistent with a presynaptic reduction in glutamic acid decarboxylase 1 (Gad1) and glutamic acid decarboxylase 2 (Gad2) levels, and GABA immunoreactivity. These data demonstrate that MeCP2 is critical for normal function of GABA-releasing neurons and that subtle dysfunction of GABAergic neurons contributes to numerous neuropsychiatric phenotypes.},

abstract = {Prenatal exposure to infection increases risk for schizophrenia, and we have hypothesized that inflammatory cytokines, generated in response to maternal infection, alter neuron development and increase risk for schizophrenia. We sought to study the effect of cytokines generated in response to infection-interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), and interleukin-6 (IL-6)-on the dendritic development of cortical neurons. Primary mixed neuronal cultures were obtained from E18 rats and exposed to 0, 100, or 1000 units (U)/ml of IL-1beta, TNFalpha, IL-6, or IL-1beta+TNFalpha for 44 h. MAP-2-positive neurons were randomly identified for each condition and the number of primary dendrites, nodes, and total dendrite length was determined. We found that 100 U of TNFalpha significantly reduced the number of nodes (27{\%}, p=0.02) and total dendritic length (14{\%}, p=0.04), but did not affect overall neuron survival. A measure of 100 U IL-1beta+TNFalpha significantly reduced the number of primary dendrites (17{\%}, p=0.006), nodes (32{\%}, p=0.001), and total dendritic length (30{\%}, p<0.0001), although it did not affect overall neuron survival. At 1000 U, each cytokine significantly reduced the number of primary dendrites (14-24{\%}), nodes (28-37{\%}), as well as total dendritic length (25-30{\%}); neuron survival was reduced by 14-21{\%}. These results indicate that inflammatory cytokines can significantly reduce dendrite development and complexity of developing cortical neurons, consistent with the neuropathology of schizophrenia. These findings also support the hypothesis that cytokines play a key mechanistic role in the link between prenatal exposure to infection and risk for schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Many gene variants are involved in the susceptibility to schizophrenia and some of them are expected to be associated with other human characters. Recently reported meta-analysis of genetic associations revealed nucleotide variants in synaptic vesicular transport/Golgi apparatus genes with schizophrenia. In this study, we selected the dymeclin gene (DYM) as a candidate gene for schizophrenia. The DYM gene encodes dymeclin that has been identified to be associated with the Golgi apparatus and with transitional vesicles of the reticulum-Golgi interface. A three-step case-control study of total of 2105 Japanese cases of schizophrenia and 2087 Japanese control subjects was carried out for tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the DYM gene and an association between an SNP, rs833497, and schizophrenia was identified (allelic P=2 x 10(-5), in the total sample). DYM is the causal gene for Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen syndrome and this study shows the second neuropsychiatric disorder in which the DYM gene is involved. The present data support the involvement of Golgi function and vesicular transport in the presynapse in schizophrenia.},

abstract = {There is increasing evidence of immune involvement in both schizophrenia and autism. Of particular interest are striking abnormalities in the expression of immune-related molecules such as cytokines in the brain and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). It is proposed that this represents a permanent state of brain immune dysregulation, which begins during early development. One possibility is that maternal infection, a known risk factor for schizophrenia and autism, sets this immune activation in motion. Several animal models are being used to investigate this hypothesis. There is also recent evidence that, among schizophrenic subjects, those associated with maternal infection display a distinctive pathology, which suggests that diverse causes for this disorder may explain some of its heterogeneity. The human and animal results related to immune involvement suggest novel therapeutic avenues based on immune interventions.},

@article{Hartl2008,
abstract = {Mouse embryonic brain development involves sequential differentiation of multipotent progenitors into neurons and glia cells. Using microarrays and large 2-DE, we investigated the mouse brain transcriptome and proteome of embryonic days 9.5, 11.5, and 13.5. During this developmental period, neural progenitor cells shift from proliferation to neuronal differentiation. As expected, we detected numerous expression changes between all time points investigated, but interestingly, the rate of alteration remained in a similar range within 2 days of development. Furthermore, up- and down-regulation of gene products was balanced at each time point which was also seen at embryonic days 16-18. We hypothesize that during embryonic development, the rate of gene expression alteration is rather constant due to limited cellular resources such as energy, space, and free water. A similar complexity in terms of expressed genes and proteins suggests that changes in relative concentrations rather than an increase in the number of gene products dominate cellular differentiation. In general, expression of metabolism and cell cycle related gene products was down-regulated when precursor cells switched from proliferation to neuronal differentiation (days 9.5-11.5), whereas neuron specific gene products were up-regulated. A detailed functional analysis revealed their implication in differentiation related processes such as rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton as well as Notch- and Wnt-signaling pathways.},

abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are believed to have genetic and environmental origins, yet in only a modest fraction of individuals can specific causes be identified. To identify further genetic risk factors, here we assess the role of de novo mutations in ASD by sequencing the exomes of ASD cases and their parents (n = 175 trios). Fewer than half of the cases (46.3{\%}) carry a missense or nonsense de novo variant, and the overall rate of mutation is only modestly higher than the expected rate. In contrast, the proteins encoded by genes that harboured de novo missense or nonsense mutations showed a higher degree of connectivity among themselves and to previous ASD genes as indexed by protein-protein interaction screens. The small increase in the rate of de novo events, when taken together with the protein interaction results, are consistent with an important but limited role for de novo point mutations in ASD, similar to that documented for de novo copy number variants. Genetic models incorporating these data indicate that most of the observed de novo events are unconnected to ASD; those that do confer risk are distributed across many genes and are incompletely penetrant (that is, not necessarily sufficient for disease). Our results support polygenic models in which spontaneous coding mutations in any of a large number of genes increases risk by 5- to 20-fold. Despite the challenge posed by such models, results from de novo events and a large parallel case-control study provide strong evidence in favour of CHD8 and KATNAL2 as genuine autism risk factors.},

abstract = {Although autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have a substantial genetic basis, most of the known genetic risk has been traced to rare variants, principally copy number variants (CNVs). To identify common risk variation, the Autism Genome Project (AGP) Consortium genotyped 1558 rigorously defined ASD families for 1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and analyzed these SNP genotypes for association with ASD. In one of four primary association analyses, the association signal for marker rs4141463, located within MACROD2, crossed the genome-wide association significance threshold of P < 5 x 10(-8). When a smaller replication sample was analyzed, the risk allele at rs4141463 was again over-transmitted; yet, consistent with the winner's curse, its effect size in the replication sample was much smaller; and, for the combined samples, the association signal barely fell below the P < 5 x 10(-8) threshold. Exploratory analyses of phenotypic subtypes yielded no significant associations after correction for multiple testing. They did, however, yield strong signals within several genes, KIAA0564, PLD5, POU6F2, ST8SIA2 and TAF1C.},

abstract = {RNA-seq is a powerful tool for the study of alternative splicing and other forms of alternative isoform expression. Understanding the regulation of these processes requires sensitive and specific detection of differential isoform abundance in comparisons between conditions, cell types, or tissues. We present DEXSeq, a statistical method to test for differential exon usage in RNA-seq data. DEXSeq uses generalized linear models and offers reliable control of false discoveries by taking biological variation into account. DEXSeq detects with high sensitivity genes, and in many cases exons, that are subject to differential exon usage. We demonstrate the versatility of DEXSeq by applying it to several data sets. The method facilitates the study of regulation and function of alternative exon usage on a genome-wide scale. An implementation of DEXSeq is available as an R/Bioconductor package.},

abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

GeneMANIA also reports weights that indicate the predictive value of each selected data set for the query. Six organisms are currently supported (Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Mus musculus, Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and hundreds of data sets have been collected from GEO, BioGRID, Pathway Commons and I2D, as well as organism-specific functional genomics data sets. Users can select arbitrary subsets of the data sets associated with an organism to perform their analyses and can upload their own data sets to analyze. The GeneMANIA algorithm performs as well or better than other gene function prediction methods on yeast and mouse benchmarks. The high accuracy of the GeneMANIA prediction algorithm, an intuitive user interface and large database make GeneMANIA a useful tool for any biologist.},

Evidence is lacking for the cumulative impact of such prenatal and postnatal environmental challenges on brain functions and vulnerability to psychiatric disease. Here, we show in a translational mouse model that combined exposure to prenatal immune challenge and peripubertal stress induces synergistic pathological effects on adult behavioral functions and neurochemistry. We further demonstrate that the prenatal insult markedly increases the vulnerability of the pubescent offspring to brain immune changes in response to stress. Our findings reveal interactions between two adverse environmental factors that have individually been associated with neuropsychiatric disease and support theories that mental illnesses with delayed onsets involve multiple environmental hits.},

These mechanisms need to be mapped onto the neurodevelopment step(s) gone awry that may be associated with cause in autism. Molecular mechanisms include: (i) regulation of gene expression; (ii) pre-mRNA splicing; (iii) protein localization, translation, and turnover; (iv) synaptic transmission; (v) cell signaling; (vi) the functions of cytoskeletal and scaffolding proteins; and (vii) the function of neuronal cell adhesion molecules. While the molecular mechanisms appear broad, they may converge on only one of a few steps during neurodevelopment that perturbs the structure, function, and/or plasticity of neuronal circuitry. While there are many genetic mutations involved, novel treatments may need to target only one of few developmental mechanisms.},

@article{Shenton2001,
abstract = {After more than 100 years of research, the neuropathology of schizophrenia remains unknown and this is despite the fact that both Kraepelin (1919/1971: Kraepelin, E., 1919/1971. Dementia praecox. Churchill Livingston Inc., New York) and Bleuler (1911/1950: Bleuler, E., 1911/1950. Dementia praecox or the group of schizophrenias. International Universities Press, New York), who first described 'dementia praecox' and the 'schizophrenias', were convinced that schizophrenia would ultimately be linked to an organic brain disorder. Alzheimer (1897: Alzheimer, A., 1897. Beitrage zur pathologischen anatomie der hirnrinde und zur anatomischen grundlage einiger psychosen. Monatsschrift fur Psychiarie und Neurologie. 2, 82-120) was the first to investigate the neuropathology of schizophrenia, though he went on to study more tractable brain diseases. The results of subsequent neuropathological studies were disappointing because of conflicting findings. Research interest thus waned and did not flourish again until 1976, following the pivotal computer assisted tomography (CT) finding of lateral ventricular enlargement in schizophrenia by Johnstone and colleagues. Since that time significant progress has been made in brain imaging, particularly with the advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), beginning with the first MRI study of schizophrenia by Smith and coworkers in 1984 (Smith, R.C., Calderon, M., Ravichandran, G.K., et al. (1984). Nuclear magnetic resonance in schizophrenia: A preliminary study. Psychiatry Res. 12, 137-147). MR in vivo imaging of the brain now confirms brain abnormalities in schizophrenia. The 193 peer reviewed MRI studies reported in the current review span the period from 1988 to August, 2000. This 12 year period has witnessed a burgeoning of MRI studies and has led to more definitive findings of brain abnormalities in schizophrenia than any other time period in the history of schizophrenia research. Such progress in defining the neuropathology of schizophrenia is largely due to advances in in vivo MRI techniques. These advances have now led to the identification of a number of brain abnormalities in schizophrenia. Some of these abnormalities confirm earlier post-mortem findings, and most are small and subtle, rather than large, thus necessitating more advanced and accurate measurement tools. These findings include ventricular enlargement (80{\%} of studies reviewed) and third ventricle enlargement (73{\%} of studies reviewed). There is also preferential involvement of medial temporal lobe structures (74{\%} of studies reviewed), which include the amygdala, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus, and neocortical temporal lobe regions (superior temporal gyrus) (100{\%} of studies reviewed). When gray and white matter of superior temporal gyrus was combined, 67{\%} of studies reported abnormalities. There was also moderate evidence for frontal lobe abnormalities (59{\%} of studies reviewed), particularly prefrontal gray matter and orbitofrontal regions. Similarly, there was moderate evidence for parietal lobe abnormalities (60{\%} of studies reviewed), particularly of the inferior parietal lobule which includes both supramarginal and angular gyri. Additionally, there was strong to moderate evidence for subcortical abnormalities (i.e. cavum septi pellucidi-92{\%} of studies reviewed, basal ganglia-68{\%} of studies reviewed, corpus callosum-63{\%} of studies reviewed, and thalamus-42{\%} of studies reviewed), but more equivocal evidence for cerebellar abnormalities (31{\%} of studies reviewed). The timing of such abnormalities has not yet been determined, although many are evident when a patient first becomes symptomatic. There is, however, also evidence that a subset of brain abnormalities may change over the course of the illness. The most parsimonious explanation is that some brain abnormalities are neurodevelopmental in origin but unfold later in development, thus setting the stage for the development of the symptoms of schizophrenia. Or there may be additional factors, such as stress or neurotoxicity, that occur during adolescence or early adulthood and are necessary for the development of schizophrenia, and may be associated with neurodegenerative changes. Importantly, as several different brain regions are involved in the neuropathology of schizophrenia, new models need to be developed and tested that explain neural circuitry abnormalities effecting brain regions not necessarily structurally proximal to each other but nonetheless functionally interrelated.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The authors examined the relationship between maternal antibody to toxoplasmosis and the risk of schizophrenia and other schizophrenia spectrum disorders in offspring. Toxoplasmosis is known to adversely affect fetal brain development. METHOD: In a nested case-control design of a large birth cohort born between 1959 and 1967, the authors conducted serological assays for Toxoplasma antibody on maternal serum specimens from pregnancies giving rise to 63 cases of schizophrenia and other schizophrenia spectrum disorders and 123 matched comparison subjects. Toxoplasma immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibody was quantified by using the Sabin-Feldman dye test. The Ig titers were classified into three groups: negative (<1:16) (reference), moderate (1:16-1:64), and high (> or =1:128). RESULTS: The adjusted odds ratio of schizophrenia/schizophrenia spectrum disorders for subjects with high maternal Toxoplasma IgG antibody titers was 2.61 (95{\%} confidence interval=1.00-6.82). There was no association between moderate Toxoplasma Ig antibody titers and the risk of schizophrenia/spectrum disorders. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that maternal exposure to toxoplasmosis may be a risk factor for schizophrenia. The findings may be explained by reactivated infection or an effect of the antibody on the developing fetus. Given that toxoplasmosis is a preventable infection, the findings, if replicated, may have implications for reducing the incidence of schizophrenia.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Even though real-time PCR has been broadly applied in biomedical sciences, data processing procedures for the analysis of quantitative real-time PCR are still lacking; specifically in the realm of appropriate statistical treatment. Confidence interval and statistical significance considerations are not explicit in many of the current data analysis approaches. Based on the standard curve method and other useful data analysis methods, we present and compare four statistical approaches and models for the analysis of real-time PCR data. RESULTS: In the first approach, a multiple regression analysis model was developed to derive DeltaDeltaCt from estimation of interaction of gene and treatment effects. In the second approach, an ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) model was proposed, and the DeltaDeltaCt can be derived from analysis of effects of variables. The other two models involve calculation DeltaCt followed by a two group t-test and non-parametric analogous Wilcoxon test. SAS programs were developed for all four models and data output for analysis of a sample set are presented. In addition, a data quality control model was developed and implemented using SAS. CONCLUSION: Practical statistical solutions with SAS programs were developed for real-time PCR data and a sample dataset was analyzed with the SAS programs. The analysis using the various models and programs yielded similar results. Data quality control and analysis procedures presented here provide statistical elements for the estimation of the relative expression of genes using real-time PCR.},

abstract = {Maternal infection during pregnancy is an environmental risk factor for the offspring to develop severe brain disorders, including schizophrenia and autism. However, only little is known about the neurodevelopmental mechanisms underlying the association between prenatal exposure to infection and the emergence of brain and behavioral dysfunctions in later life. Using a mouse model of prenatal immune challenge by the viral mimic polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid (PolyI:C), we explored the acute effects of maternal immune activation during pregnancy on the development of the fetal dopaminergic system, a neurotransmitter system known to be affected in schizophrenia and related disorders. We found that maternal immunological stimulation in early/middle pregnancy increased the number of mesencephalic dopamine neurons in the fetal brain at middle/late and late gestation. This effect was paralleled by changes in fetal expression of several genes known to be involved in dopamine neuron development, including the inductive signals sonic hedgehog (Shh) and fibroblast growth factor 8 (Fgf8), as well as transcription factors Nurr1 and Pitx3. These findings provide initial in vivo evidence for a modulation of fetal dopaminergic development by maternal immune activation during pregnancy. Additional investigations of the neurodevelopmental effects of prenatal immune challenge are thus clearly warranted in order to further validate whether abnormal dopaminergic development may be a critical neuropathological mechanism underlying the precipitation of schizophrenia-like brain and behavioral dysfunctions emerging after in utero exposure to infection.},

@article{Ben-Ari2007,
abstract = {Developing networks follow common rules to shift from silent cells to coactive networks that operate via thousands of synapses. This review deals with some of these rules and in particular those concerning the crucial role of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobuytric acid (GABA), which operates primarily via chloride-permeable GABA(A) receptor channels. In all developing animal species and brain structures investigated, neurons have a higher intracellular chloride concentration at an early stage leading to an efflux of chloride and excitatory actions of GABA in immature neurons. This triggers sodium spikes, activates voltage-gated calcium channels, and acts in synergy with NMDA channels by removing the voltage-dependent magnesium block. GABA signaling is also established before glutamatergic transmission, suggesting that GABA is the principal excitatory transmitter during early development. In fact, even before synapse formation, GABA signaling can modulate the cell cycle and migration. The consequence of these rules is that developing networks generate primitive patterns of network activity, notably the giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs), largely through the excitatory actions of GABA and its synergistic interactions with glutamate signaling. These early types of network activity are likely required for neurons to fire together and thus to "wire together" so that functional units within cortical networks are formed. In addition, depolarizing GABA has a strong impact on synaptic plasticity and pathological insults, notably seizures of the immature brain. In conclusion, it is suggested that an evolutionary preserved role for excitatory GABA in immature cells provides an important mechanism in the formation of synapses and activity in neuronal networks.},

abstract = {AIMS: Progressive cognitive decline has been an important issue in the treatment and care of patients with schizophrenia. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the rate-limiting enzyme for the biosynthesis of catecholamine, including dopamine and noradrenaline. In this report, we examined a possible association of a genetic variant in the TH promoter region. METHODS: Association of a genetic variant in the TH promoter region, C-824T (rs10770141), with intellectual ability in 132 patients with schizophrenia and 282 healthy subjects was examined. The transcriptional activity of the plasmids harboring the TH promoter region with either C or T nucleotide at -824 was assayed using a luciferase gene as a reporter. RESULTS: We found significant effects of the genotype on the full-scale IQ, verbal IQ, and performance IQ, in patients with schizophrenia. IQ was lower in individuals with the C/C genotype than those with T carriers. The plasmid with the T allele at -824 showed higher transcriptional activity than that with the C allele in a transient transfection experiment using a luciferase gene as a reporter, implying that the T carriers may have higher TH activities and retain higher levels of catecholamines in the brain. CONCLUSIONS: The present data suggest that the biosynthesis of catecholamine by the action of TH should be deeply involved in decreased intellectual ability in patients with schizophrenia. This is the first report, as far as we know, showing a correlation between TH expression and IQ in humans.},

Information on the monthly number of cases of paralytic poliomyelitis was obtained for each province in Finland. The authors analyzed the incidence of births of individuals who later developed schizophrenia by using a Poisson regression model with year and place of birth, age, sex, season of birth, and smoothed incidence of poliomyelitis in different gestational periods as explanatory variables. RESULTS: An association between the incidence of poliomyelitis and the incidence of births 5 months later of individuals who later developed schizophrenia was observed. Without controlling for seasonality, the effect was significant throughout the second trimester. CONCLUSIONS: Second-trimester exposure to poliovirus infection may increase the risk for the later development of schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Two isoforms of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67 and GAD65) and their mRNAs were localized in the rat brain by immunohistochemistry and nonradioactive in situ hybridization methods with digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probes. In most brain regions, both GAD isoforms were present in neuronal cell bodies as well as axon terminals. A few populations of neurons, such as those in the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, exhibited similar cell body labeling for both GADs. However, in many brain regions, the cell bodies that were immunoreactive for GAD67 were often more numerous than those that were immunoreactive for GAD65. In contrast, the density (quantity) of GAD65-immunoreactive axon terminals was higher than that of GAD67-immunoreactive terminals. Strong parallels were observed between the intensity of immunohistochemical labeling of cell bodies and the levels of mRNA labeling for both GAD isoforms. Many groups of GAD-containing cell bodies were distinctly labeled for GAD67, and these same groups of neurons were heavily labeled for GAD67 mRNA. Such neurons included Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex, nonpyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex, and neurons of the reticular nucleus of the thalamus. Similar parallels in labeling were observed for GAD65 and its mRNA. Distinct cell body labeling for the protein and associated high levels of GAD65 mRNA were found in neurons of the reticular nucleus of the thalamus and periglomerular cells in the olfactory bulb. However, many cell bodies were not readily labeled for GAD65 with immunohistochemical methods. Such absence or weakness of cell body labeling for the protein was associated with low or moderate levels of GAD65 mRNA. Even though light cell body staining was frequently observed for GAD65 and its mRNA, strong axon terminal labeling for GAD65 was present. Thus, in the deep cerebellar nuclei to which the Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex project, strong terminal labeling was observed for both GAD isoforms even though only light cell body labeling of the Purkinje cells was obtained for GAD65 and its mRNA. The findings suggest that the two isoforms of GAD are present in most classes of GABA neurons but that they are not similarly distributed within the neurons. GAD67 is present in readily detectable amounts in many GAD-containing cell bodies whereas GAD65 is particularly prominent in many axon terminals. In addition, neurons that express either form of GAD mRNA also express the corresponding protein. Levels of labeling for the GAD mRNAs suggest that, under normal conditions, the synthesis of GAD65 is frequently lower than that of GAD67.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

The higher order functional information is stored in the PATHWAY database, which contains graphical representations of cellular processes, such as metabolism, membrane transport, signal transduction and cell cycle. The PATHWAY database is supplemented by a set of ortholog group tables for the information about conserved subpathways (pathway motifs), which are often encoded by positionally coupled genes on the chromosome and which are especially useful in predicting gene functions. A third database in KEGG is LIGAND for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme molecules and enzymatic reactions. KEGG provides Java graphics tools for browsing genome maps, comparing two genome maps and manipulating expression maps, as well as computational tools for sequence comparison, graph comparison and path computation.

abstract = {The molecular mechanisms underlying angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL), a common type of mature T cell lymphoma of poor prognosis, are largely unknown. Here we report a frequent somatic mutation in RHOA (encoding p.Gly17Val) using exome and transcriptome sequencing of samples from individuals with AITL. Further examination of the RHOA mutation encoding p.Gly17Val in 239 lymphoma samples showed that the mutation was specific to T cell lymphoma and was absent from B cell lymphoma. We demonstrate that the RHOA mutation encoding p.Gly17Val, which was found in 53.3{\%} (24 of 45) of the AITL cases examined, is oncogenic in nature using multiple molecular assays. Molecular modeling and docking simulations provided a structural basis for the loss of GTPase activity in the RHOA Gly17Val mutant. Our experimental data and modeling results suggest that the RHOA mutation encoding p.Gly17Val is a driver mutation in AITL. On the basis of these data and through integrated pathway analysis, we build a comprehensive signaling network for AITL oncogenesis.},

abstract = {The broad variation in phenotypes and severities within autism spectrum disorders suggests the involvement of multiple predisposing factors, interacting in complex ways with normal developmental courses and gradients. Identification of these factors, and the common developmental path into which they feed, is hampered by the large degrees of convergence from causal factors to altered brain development, and divergence from abnormal brain development into altered cognition and behaviour. Genetic, neurochemical, neuroimaging, and behavioural findings on autism, as well as studies of normal development and of genetic syndromes that share symptoms with autism, offer hypotheses as to the nature of causal factors and their possible effects on the structure and dynamics of neural systems. Such alterations in neural properties may in turn perturb activity-dependent development, giving rise to a complex behavioural syndrome many steps removed from the root causes. Animal models based on genetic, neurochemical, neurophysiological, and behavioural manipulations offer the possibility of exploring these developmental processes in detail, as do human studies addressing endophenotypes beyond the diagnosis itself.},

abstract = {Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors are densely expressed in the spinal dorsal horn, but their functional significance in pain processing is not understood. By disrupting the genes encoding GluR-A or GluR-B, we generated mice exhibiting increased or decreased numbers of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors, respectively. Here, we demonstrate that AMPA receptors are critical determinants of nociceptive plasticity and inflammatory pain. A reduction in the number of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors and density of AMPA channel currents in spinal neurons of GluR-A-deficient mice is accompanied by a loss of nociceptive plasticity in vitro and a reduction in acute inflammatory hyperalgesia in vivo. In contrast, an increase in spinal Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors in GluR-B-deficient mice facilitated nociceptive plasticity and enhanced long-lasting inflammatory hyperalgesia. Thus, AMPA receptors are not mere determinants of fast synaptic transmission underlying basal pain sensitivity as previously thought, but are critically involved in activity-dependent changes in synaptic processing of nociceptive inputs.},

The cellular diversity of the brain necessitates a cellular resolution approach towards understanding the functional genomics of the nervous system. We describe here an anatomically comprehensive digital atlas containing the expression patterns of approximately 20,000 genes in the adult mouse brain. Data were generated using automated high-throughput procedures for in situ hybridization and data acquisition, and are publicly accessible online. Newly developed image-based informatics tools allow global genome-scale structural analysis and cross-correlation, as well as identification of regionally enriched genes. Unbiased fine-resolution analysis has identified highly specific cellular markers as well as extensive evidence of cellular heterogeneity not evident in classical neuroanatomical atlases. This highly standardized atlas provides an open, primary data resource for a wide variety of further studies concerning brain organization and function.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Premorbid neurocognitive, neuromotor, and behavioral function tends to be disturbed in schizophrenia. We previously demonstrated that a birth cohort clinically and serologically documented with prenatal rubella evidenced a marked increase in risk of nonaffective psychosis. In our study, we examined whether rubella-exposed subjects destined to develop schizophrenia and other schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD), compared with exposed control subjects, had greater impairment in several premorbid functions. METHODS: Subjects were interviewed using a direct, comprehensive research assessment and diagnosed by consensus. We compared the degree of IQ decline, as well as premorbid neuromotor and behavioral dysfunction, between rubella-exposed subjects who developed schizophrenia spectrum psychosis (SSP) and exposed control subjects from the cohort. We also compared the gestational timing of rubella infection between the cases and control subjects. RESULTS: This rubella-exposed birth cohort evidenced a markedly increased risk of SSD (20.4{\%} or 11/53). Rubella-exposed SSP cases, compared with rubella-exposed control subjects, demonstrated a decline in IQ from childhood to adolescence, and increased premorbid neuromotor and behavioral abnormalities. Moreover, it appears that early gestational rubella exposure may represent a period of increased vulnerability for SSD. CONCLUSIONS: These findings link a known prenatal exposure, a deviant neurodevelopmental trajectory in childhood and adolescence, and SSP in adulthood within the same individuals.},

abstract = {Gene co-expression networks are increasingly used to explore the system-level functionality of genes. The network construction is conceptually straightforward: nodes represent genes and nodes are connected if the corresponding genes are significantly co-expressed across appropriately chosen tissue samples. In reality, it is tricky to define the connections between the nodes in such networks. An important question is whether it is biologically meaningful to encode gene co-expression using binary information (connected=1, unconnected=0). We describe a general framework for ;soft' thresholding that assigns a connection weight to each gene pair. This leads us to define the notion of a weighted gene co-expression network. For soft thresholding we propose several adjacency functions that convert the co-expression measure to a connection weight. For determining the parameters of the adjacency function, we propose a biologically motivated criterion (referred to as the scale-free topology criterion). We generalize the following important network concepts to the case of weighted networks. First, we introduce several node connectivity measures and provide empirical evidence that they can be important for predicting the biological significance of a gene. Second, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the ;weighted' topological overlap measure (used to define gene modules) leads to more cohesive modules than its ;unweighted' counterpart. Third, we generalize the clustering coefficient to weighted networks. Unlike the unweighted clustering coefficient, the weighted clustering coefficient is not inversely related to the connectivity. We provide a model that shows how an inverse relationship between clustering coefficient and connectivity arises from hard thresholding. We apply our methods to simulated data, a cancer microarray data set, and a yeast microarray data set.},

abstract = {Tyrosine hydroxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme of catecholamine biosynthesis; it uses tetrahydrobiopterin and molecular oxygen to convert tyrosine to DOPA. Its amino terminal 150 amino acids comprise a domain whose structure is involved in regulating the enzyme's activity. Modes of regulation include phosphorylation by multiple kinases at four different serine residues, and dephosphorylation by two phosphatases. The enzyme is inhibited in feedback fashion by the catecholamine neurotransmitters. Dopamine binds to TyrH competitively with tetrahydrobiopterin, and interacts with the R domain. TyrH activity is modulated by protein-protein interactions with enzymes in the same pathway or the tetrahydrobiopterin pathway, structural proteins considered to be chaperones that mediate the neuron's oxidative state, and the protein that transfers dopamine into secretory vesicles. TyrH is modified in the presence of NO, resulting in nitration of tyrosine residues and the glutathionylation of cysteine residues.},

abstract = {Many high-throughput biological data analyses require the calculation of large correlation matrices and/or clustering of a large number of objects. The standard R function for calculating Pearson correlation can handle calculations without missing values efficiently, but is inefficient when applied to data sets with a relatively small number of missing data. We present an implementation of Pearson correlation calculation that can lead to substantial speedup on data with relatively small number of missing entries. Further, we parallelize all calculations and thus achieve further speedup on systems where parallel processing is available. A robust correlation measure, the biweight midcorrelation, is implemented in a similar manner and provides comparable speed. The functions cor and bicor for fast Pearson and biweight midcorrelation, respectively, are part of the updated, freely available R package WGCNA.The hierarchical clustering algorithm implemented in R function hclust is an order n(3) (n is the number of clustered objects) version of a publicly available clustering algorithm (Murtagh 2012). We present the package flashClust that implements the original algorithm which in practice achieves order approximately n(2), leading to substantial time savings when clustering large data sets.},

abstract = {Researchers have long noted an excess of patients with schizophrenia were born during the months of January and March. This winter birth effect has been hypothesized to result either from various causes such as vitamin D deficiency (McGrath, 1999; McGrath et al., 2010), or from maternal infection during pregnancy. Infection with a number of viruses during pregnancy including influenza, and rubella are known to increase the risk of schizophrenia in the offspring (Brown, 2006). Animal models using influenza virus or Poly I:C, a viral mimic, have been able to replicate many of the brain morphological, genetic, and behavioral deficits of schizophrenia (Meyer et al., 2006, 2008a, 2009; Bitanihirwe et al., 2010; Meyer and Feldon, 2010; Short et al., 2010). Using a murine model of prenatal viral infection, our laboratory has shown that viral infection on embryonic days 9, 16, and 18 leads to abnormal expression of brain genes and brain structural abnormalities in the exposed offspring (Fatemi et al., 2005, 2008a,b, 2009a,b). The purpose of the current study was to examine gene expression and morphological changes in the placenta, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex as a result of viral infection on embryonic day 7 of pregnancy. Pregnant mice were either infected with influenza virus [A/WSN/33 strain (H1N1)] or sham-infected with vehicle solution. At E16, placentas were harvested and prepared for either microarray analysis or for light microscopy. We observed significant, upregulation of 77 genes and significant downregulation of 93 genes in placentas. In brains of exposed offspring following E7 infection, there were changes in gene expression in prefrontal cortex (6 upregulated and 24 downregulated at P0; 5 upregulated and 14 downregulated at P56) and hippocampus (4 upregulated and 6 downregulated at P0; 6 upregulated and 13 downregulated at P56). QRT-PCR verified the direction and magnitude of change for a number of genes associated with hypoxia, inflammation, schizophrenia, and autism. Placentas from infected mice showed a number of morphological abnormalities including presence of thrombi and increased presence of immune cells. Additionally, we searched for presence of H1N1 viral-specific genes for M1/M2, NA, and NS1 in placentas of infected mice and brains of exposed offspring and found none. Our results demonstrate that prenatal viral infection disrupts structure and gene expression of the placenta, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex potentially explaining deleterious effects in the exposed offspring without evidence for presence of viral RNAs in the target tissues.},

abstract = {CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling has been reported to regulate three essential processes for the establishment of neural networks in different neuronal systems: neuronal migration, cell positioning and axon wiring. However, it is not known whether it regulates the development of A9-A10 tyrosine hydroxylase positive (TH(+)) midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons. We report here that Cxcl12 is expressed in the meninges surrounding the ventral midbrain (VM), whereas CXCR4 is present in NURR1(+) mDA precursors and mDA neurons from E10.5 to E14.5. CXCR4 is activated in NURR1(+) cells as they migrate towards the meninges. Accordingly, VM meninges and CXCL12 promoted migration and neuritogenesis of TH(+) cells in VM explants in a CXCR4-dependent manner. Moreover, in vivo electroporation of Cxcl12 at E12.5 in the basal plate resulted in lateral migration, whereas expression in the midline resulted in retention of TH(+) cells in the IZ close to the midline. Analysis of Cxcr4(-/-) mice revealed the presence of VM TH(+) cells with disoriented processes in the intermediate zone (IZ) at E11.5 and marginal zone (MZ) at E14. Consistently, pharmacological blockade of CXCR4 or genetic deletion of Cxcr4 resulted in an accumulation of TH(+) cells in the lateral aspect of the IZ at E14, indicating that CXCR4 is required for the radial migration of mDA neurons in vivo. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that CXCL12/CXCR4 regulates the migration and orientation of processes in A9-A10 mDA neurons.},

@article{Muller2010,
abstract = {Although an immune dysfunction and the involvement of infectious agents in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia are discussed since decades, the field never came into the mainstream of research. In schizophrenia a blunted type-1 immune response seems to be associated with a dysbalance in the activation of the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and in the tryptophan - kynurenine metabolism resulting in increased production of kynurenic acid in schizophrenia. This is associated with an imbalance in the glutamatergic neurotransmission, leading to an NMDA antagonism in schizophrenia. The immunological effects of antipsychotics rebalance partly the immune imbalance and the overweight of the production of the kynurenic acid. This immunological imbalance results in an inflammatory state combined with increased prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production and increased cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. COX-2 inhibitors have been tested in clinical trials, pointing to favourable effects in schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Perinatal infections are a risk factor for fetal neurological pathologies, including cerebral palsy and schizophrenia. Cytokines that are produced as part of the inflammatory response are proposed to partially mediate the neurological injury. This study investigated the effects of intraperitoneal injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to pregnant rats on the production of cytokines and stress markers in the fetal environment. Gestation day 18 pregnant rats were treated with LPS (100 microg/kg body wt i.p.), and maternal serum, amniotic fluid, placenta, chorioamnion, and fetal brain were harvested at 1, 6, 12, and 24 h posttreatment to assay for LPS-induced changes in cytokine protein (ELISA) and mRNA (real-time RT-PCR) levels. We observed induction of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) as well as the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in the maternal serum within 6 h of LPS exposure. Similarly, proinflammatory cytokines were induced in the amniotic fluid in response to LPS; however, no significant induction of IL-10 was observed in the amniotic fluid. LPS-induced mRNA changes included upregulation of the stress-related peptide corticotropin-releasing factor in the fetal whole brain, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-10 in the chorioamnion, and TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 in the placenta. These findings suggest that maternal infections may lead to an unbalanced inflammatory reaction in the fetal environment that activates the fetal stress axis.},

@article{Meyer2009a,
abstract = {RATIONALE: Prenatal exposure to infection is a notable environmental risk factor in the development of schizophrenia. One prevalent hypothesis suggests that infection-induced disruption of early prenatal brain development predisposes the organism to long-lasting structural and functional brain abnormalities. Many of the prenatal infection-induced functional brain abnormalities appear to be closely associated with imbalances in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system in adult life, suggesting that disruption of functional and structural dopaminergic development may be at the core of the developmental neuropathology associated with psychosis-related abnormalities induced by prenatal exposure to infection. OBJECTIVES: In this review, we integrate recent findings derived from experimental models in animals with parallel research in humans which supports this hypothesis. We thereby highlight the developmental perspective of abnormal DA functions following in-utero exposure to infection in relation to the developmental and maturational mechanisms potentially involved in schizophrenia. RESULTS: Experimental investigations show that early prenatal immune challenge can lead to the emergence of early structural and functional alterations in the mesocorticolimbic DA system, long before the onset of the full spectrum of psychosis-associated behavioral and cognitive abnormalities in adulthood. CONCLUSIONS: Dopaminergic mal-development in general, and following prenatal immune activation in particular, may represent a primary etiopathological mechanism in the development of schizophrenia and related disorders. This hypothesis differs from the view that dopaminergic abnormalities in schizophrenia may be secondary to abnormalities in other brain structures and/or neurotransmitter systems. The existence of primary dopaminergic mechanisms may have important implications for the identification and early treatment of individuals prodromally symptomatic for schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Microglial cells are among the first and dominant cell types to respond to CNS injury. Following calcium influx, microglial activation leads to a variety of cellular responses, such as proliferation and release of cytotoxic and neurotrophic mediators. Allograft inflammatory factor-1, AIF-1 is a highly conserved EF-handed, putative calcium binding peptide, associated with microglia activation in the brain. Here, we have analyzed the expression of AIF-1 following spinal cord injury at the lesion site and at remote brain regions. Following spinal cord injury, AIF-1+ cells accumulated in parenchymal pan-necrotic areas and perivascular Virchow-Robin spaces. Subsequent to culmination at day 3--a situation characterized by infiltrating blood borne macrophages and microglia activation--AIF-1+ cell numbers decreased until day 7. In remote areas of Wallerian degeneration and delayed neuronal death, a more discrete and delayed activation pattern of AIF-1+ microglia/macrophages reaching maximum levels at day 14 was observed. There was a considerable match between AIF-1+ cells and PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) or Ki-67+ labeled cells. AIF-1 expression preceded the expression of ED1, thus indicating a pre-phagocytic role. It appears that AIF-1+ microglia/macrophages are among the earliest cells to respond to spinal cord injury. Our results suggest a role of AIF-1 in the initiation of the early microglial response leading to activation and proliferation essential for the acute response to CNS injury. AIF-1 might modulate microgliosis influencing the efficacy of tissue debris removal, myelin degradation, recruitment of oligodendrocytes and re-organisation of the CNS architecture.},

In order to support such practice, this study examines the mean squared errors of r and several prominent formulas. The results reveal specific situations in which the sample correlation coefficient performs better than the unbiased and nearly unbiased estimators, facilitating recommendation of r as an effect size index for the strength of linear association between two variables. In addition, related issues of estimating the squared simple correlation coefficient are also considered.},

@article{Langfelder2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Correlation networks are increasingly being used in bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial. RESULTS: The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive collection of R functions for performing various aspects of weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes functions for network construction, module detection, gene selection, calculations of topological properties, data simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software. Along with the R package we also present R software tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be applied to a variety of different settings. CONCLUSION: The WGCNA package provides R functions for weighted correlation network analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression data. The R package along with its source code and additional material are freely available at http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA.},

Laminin-511 is highly expressed in the intestine and its absence causes severe malformation of the intestine and embryonic lethality. To understand the mechanistic role of laminin-511 in tissue homeostasis, we used RNA profiling of embryonic intestinal tissue of lama5 knockout mice and identified a lama5 specific gene expression signature. By combining cell culture experiments with mediated knockdown approaches, we provide a mechanistic link between laminin alpha5 gene deficiency and the physiological phenotype. We show that laminin alpha5 plays a crucial role in both epithelial and mesenchymal cell behavior by inhibiting Wnt and activating PI3K signaling. We conclude that conflicting signals are elicited in the absence of lama5, which alter cell adhesion, migration as well as epithelial and muscle differentiation. Conversely, adhesion to laminin-511 may serve as a potent regulator of known interconnected PI3K/Akt and Wnt signaling pathways. Thus deregulated adhesion to laminin-511 may be instrumental in diseases such as human pathologies of the gut where laminin-511 is abnormally expressed as it is shown here.},

abstract = {We have determined the nucleotide sequence of the plasmid genes blaT-4 and blaT-5 which encode the broad-substrate-range beta-lactamases TEM-4 and TEM-5, respectively. The TEM-4 enzyme, which confers high-level resistance to cefotaxime (Ctx) and ceftazidime (Caz), differed from the TEM-1 penicillinase by four amino acid substitutions. Two of the mutations are identical to those responsible for the wide substrate range of the TEM-3 beta-lactamase which hydrolyses Ctx and Caz. The amino acid sequence of TEM-5, which confers higher levels of resistance to Caz than to other recently developed cephalosporins, differed from that of TEM-1 by three mutations distinct from those of TEM-4. Analysis of the location of the mutations in the primary and tertiary structures of class A beta-lactamases suggests that interactions between the substituted residues and beta-lactam antibiotics non-hydrolysable by TEM-1 and TEM-2 allow TEM-4 and TEM-5 to hydrolyse efficiently novel broad-spectrum cephalosporins such as Ctx and Caz.},

Experimental data have been generated on a huge number of organisms, tissue types, treatment conditions and disease states. The Gene Expression Omnibus (Barrett et al., 2005), developed by the National Center for Bioinformatics (NCBI) at the National Institutes of Health is a repository of nearly 140,000 gene expression experiments. The BioConductor project (Gentleman et al., 2004) is an open-source and open-development software project built in the R statistical programming environment (R Development core Team, 2005) for the analysis and comprehension of genomic data. The tools contained in the BioConductor project represent many state-of-the-art methods for the analysis of microarray and genomics data. We have developed a software tool that allows access to the wealth of information within GEO directly from BioConductor, eliminating many the formatting and parsing problems that have made such analyses labor-intensive in the past. The software, called GEOquery, effectively establishes a bridge between GEO and BioConductor. Easy access to GEO data from BioConductor will likely lead to new analyses of GEO data using novel and rigorous statistical and bioinformatic tools. Facilitating analyses and meta-analyses of microarray data will increase the efficiency with which biologically important conclusions can be drawn from published genomic data.

abstract = {Understanding the cell-cell interactions that control CNS development and function has long been limited by the lack of methods to cleanly separate neural cell types. Here we describe methods for the prospective isolation and purification of astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes from developing and mature mouse forebrain. We used FACS (fluorescent-activated cell sorting) to isolate astrocytes from transgenic mice that express enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of an S100beta promoter. Using Affymetrix GeneChip Arrays, we then created a transcriptome database of the expression levels of >20,000 genes by gene profiling these three main CNS neural cell types at various postnatal ages between postnatal day 1 (P1) and P30. This database provides a detailed global characterization and comparison of the genes expressed by acutely isolated astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes. We found that Aldh1L1 is a highly specific antigenic marker for astrocytes with a substantially broader pattern of astrocyte expression than the traditional astrocyte marker GFAP. Astrocytes were enriched in specific metabolic and lipid synthetic pathways, as well as the draper/Megf10 and Mertk/integrin alpha(v)beta5 phagocytic pathways suggesting that astrocytes are professional phagocytes. Our findings call into question the concept of a "glial" cell class as the gene profiles of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are as dissimilar to each other as they are to neurons. This transcriptome database of acutely isolated purified astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes provides a resource to the neuroscience community by providing improved cell-type-specific markers and for better understanding of neural development, function, and disease.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Maternal infection during pregnancy increases risk of severe neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and autism, in the offspring. The most consistent brain structural abnormality in patients with schizophrenia is enlarged lateral ventricles. However, it is unknown whether the aetiology of ventriculomegaly in schizophrenia involves prenatal infectious processes. The present experiments tested the hypothesis that there is a causal relationship between prenatal immune challenge and emergence of ventricular abnormalities relevant to schizophrenia in adulthood. METHOD: We used an established mouse model of maternal immune activation (MIA) by the viral mimic PolyI:C administered in early (day 9) or late (day 17) gestation. Automated voxel-based morphometry mapped cerebrospinal fluid across the whole brain of adult offspring and the results were validated by manual region-of-interest tracing of the lateral ventricles. Parallel behavioral testing determined the existence of schizophrenia-related sensorimotor gating abnormalities. RESULTS: PolyI:C-induced immune activation, in early but not late gestation, caused marked enlargement of lateral ventricles in adulthood, without affecting total white and grey matter volumes. This early exposure disrupted sensorimotor gating, in the form of prepulse inhibition. Identical immune challenge in late gestation resulted in significant expansion of 4(th) ventricle volume but did not disrupt sensorimotor gating. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide the first experimental evidence that prenatal immune activation is an environmental risk factor for adult ventricular enlargement relevant to schizophrenia. The data indicate immune-associated environmental insults targeting early foetal development may have more extensive neurodevelopmental impact than identical insults in late prenatal life.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Published evidence on established and theoretical connections between immune system dysfunction and schizophrenia is reviewed, with a discussion of developments in the search for immunologically-targeted treatments. SUMMARY: A growing body of evidence indicates that immunologic influences may play an important role in the etiology and course of schizophrenia. A literature search identified more than 100 articles pertaining to suspected immunologic influences on schizophrenia published over the past 15 years. Schizophrenia researchers have explored a wide range of potential immune system-related causal or contributory factors, including neurobiological and neuroanatomical disorders, genetic abnormalities, and environmental influences such as maternal perinatal infection. Efforts to establish an immunologic basis for schizophrenia and identify reliable immune markers continue to be hindered by sampling challenges and methodological problems. In aggregate, the available evidence indicates that at least some cases of schizophrenia have an immunologic component, suggesting that immune-focused prevention strategies (e.g., counseling of pregnant women to avoid immune stressors) and close monitoring of at-risk children are appropriate. While antipsychotics remain the standard treatments for schizophrenia, a variety of drugs with immunologic effects have been investigated as adjunctive therapies, with variable and sometimes conflicting results; these include the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor celecoxib, immune-modulating agents (e.g., azathioprine and various anticytokine agents such as atlizumab, anakinra, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha blockers), and an investigational anti-interferon-gamma agent. CONCLUSION: The published evidence indicates that immune system dysfunction related to genetic, environmental, and neurobiological influences may play a role in the etiology of schizophrenia in a subset of patients.},

@article{Brooks2011,
abstract = {Alternative splicing is generally controlled by proteins that bind directly to regulatory sequence elements and either activate or repress splicing of adjacent splice sites in a target pre-mRNA. Here, we have combined RNAi and mRNA-seq to identify exons that are regulated by Pasilla (PS), the Drosophila melanogaster ortholog of mammalian NOVA1 and NOVA2. We identified 405 splicing events in 323 genes that are significantly affected upon depletion of ps, many of which were annotated as being constitutively spliced. The sequence regions upstream and within PS-repressed exons and downstream from PS-activated exons are enriched for YCAY repeats, and these are consistent with the location of these motifs near NOVA-regulated exons in mammals. Thus, the RNA regulatory map of PS and NOVA1/2 is highly conserved between insects and mammals despite the fact that the target gene orthologs regulated by PS and NOVA1/2 are almost entirely nonoverlapping. This observation suggests that the regulatory codes of individual RNA binding proteins may be nearly immutable, yet the regulatory modules controlled by these proteins are highly evolvable.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence from genetic association studies implicate genes involved in neural migration associated with schizophrenia risk. Neural stem/progenitor cell cultures (neurosphere-derived cells) from olfactory mucosa of schizophrenia patients have significantly dysregulated expression of genes in focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling, a key pathway regulating cell adhesion and migration. The aim of this study was to investigate whether olfactory neurosphere-derived cells from schizophrenia patients have altered cell adhesion, cell motility, and focal adhesion dynamics. METHODS: Olfactory neurosphere-derived cells from nine male schizophrenia patients and nine male healthy control subjects were used. Cells were assayed for cell adhesion and cell motility and analyzed for integrins and FAK proteins. Focal adhesions were counted and measured in fixed cells, and time-lapse imaging was used to assess cell motility and focal adhesion dynamics. RESULTS: Patient-derived cells were less adhesive and more motile than cells derived from healthy control subjects, and their motility was reduced to control cell levels by integrin-blocking antibodies and by inhibition of FAK. Vinculin-stained focal adhesion complexes were significantly smaller and fewer in patient cells. Time-lapse imaging of cells expressing FAK tagged with green fluorescent protein revealed that the disassembly of focal adhesions was significantly faster in patient cells. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence for altered motility and focal adhesion dynamics in patient-derived cells is consistent with dysregulated gene expression in the FAK signaling pathway in these cells. Alterations in cell adhesion dynamics and cell motility could bias the trajectory of brain development in schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Tyrosine hydroxylase's catalysis of tyrosine to dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) is the highly regulated, rate-limiting step catalyzing the synthesis of the catecholamine neurotransmitter dopamine. Phosphorylation, cofactor-mediated regulation, and the cell's redox status, have been shown to regulate the enzyme's activity. This paper incorporates these regulatory mechanisms into an integrated dynamic model that is capable of demonstrating relative rates of dopamine synthesis under various physiological conditions. Most of the kinetic equations and substrate parameters used in the model correspond with published experimental data, while a few which were not available in literature have been optimized based on explicit assumptions. This kinetic pathway model permits a comparison of the relative regulatory contributions made by variations in substrate, phosphorylation, and redox status on enzymatic activity and permits predictions of potential disease states. For example, the model correctly predicts the recent observation that individuals with haemochromatosis and having excessive iron accumulation are at increased risk for acquiring Parkinsonism, a defect in neuronal dopamine synthesis (Bartzokis et al., 2004; Costello et al., 2004). Alpha synuclein mediated regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase has also been incorporated in the model, allowing an insight into the overexpression and aggregation of alpha synuclein in Parkinson's disease.},

abstract = {During development, Gamma-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) neurons mature at early stages, long before excitatory neurons. Conversely, GABA reuptake transporters become operative later than glutamate transporters. GABA is therefore not removed efficiently from the extracellular domain and it can exert significant paracrine effects. Hence, GABA-mediated activity is a prominent source of overall neural activity in developing CNS networks, while neurons extend dendrites and axons, and establish synaptic connections. One of the unique features of GABAergic functional plasticity is that in early development, activation of GABA(A) receptors results in depolarizing (mainly excitatory) responses and Ca(2+) influx. Although there is strong evidence from several areas of the CNS that GABA plays a significant role in neurite growth not only during development but also during adult neurogenesis, surprisingly little effort has been made into putting all these observations into a common framework in an attempt to understand the general rules that regulate these basic and evolutionary well-conserved processes. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge in this important field. In order to decipher common, universal features and highlight differences between systems throughout development, we compare findings about dendritic proliferation and remodeling in different areas of the nervous system and species, and we also review recent evidence for a role in axonal elongation. In addition to early developmental aspects, we also consider the GABAergic role in dendritic growth during adult neurogenesis, extending our discussion to the roles played by GABA during dendritic proliferation in early developing networks versus adult, well established networks.},

It has been widely adopted in genetic studies, including genome-wide association studies and, more recently, exome sequencing studies. However, significance testing in both genome-wide and exome-wide studies must adopt stringent significance thresholds to allow multiple testing, and it is useful only when studies have adequate statistical power, which depends on the characteristics of the phenotype and the putative genetic variant, as well as the study design. Here, we review the principles and applications of significance testing and power calculation, including recently proposed gene-based tests for rare variants.},

Unexpectedly, recent studies reveal that a number of these proteins, in addition to their immunological roles, are essential for the establishment, function, and modification of synaptic connections. These include proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNFalpha, IL-6), proteins of the innate immune system (e.g., complement C1q and C3, pentraxins, Dscam), members of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) family, and MHCI-binding immunoreceptors and their components (e.g., PIRB, Ly49, DAP12, CD3zeta). Understanding how these proteins function in neurons will clarify the molecular basis of fundamental events in brain development and plasticity and may add a new dimension to our understanding of neural-immune interactions in health and disease.},

abstract = {Prenatal exposure to infections represents a risk factor for the emergence of neuropsychiatric disorders in later life, including schizophrenia and autism. However, it remains essentially unknown whether this association is primarily attributable to prenatal and/or postnatal maternal effects on the offspring. Here, we addressed this issue by dissecting the relative contributions of prenatal inflammatory events and postnatal maternal factors in an animal model of prenatal viral-like infection. Pregnant mice were exposed to the inflammatory agent polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid (PolyI:C; 5 mg/kg, i.v.) or vehicle treatment on gestation day 9, and offspring born to PolyI:C- and vehicle-treated dams were cross fostered to surrogate rearing mothers that had either experienced inflammatory or sham treatment during pregnancy. We demonstrate that a variety of dopamine- and glutamate-related pharmacological and neuroanatomical disturbances emerge after prenatal immune challenge regardless of whether neonates were raised by vehicle- or PolyI:C-exposed surrogate mothers. However, the adoption of prenatal control animals to immune-challenged surrogate mothers was also sufficient to induce specific pharmacological and neuroanatomical abnormalities in the fostered offspring. Multiple schizophrenia-related dysfunctions emerging after prenatal immune challenge are thus mediated by prenatal but not postnatal maternal effects on the offspring, but immunological stress during pregnancy may affect postpartum maternal factors in such a way that being reared by an immune-challenged surrogate mother can confer risk for distinct forms of psychopathology in adult life.},

The system is built with 82 complete genomes organized into gene families and subfamilies, and their evolutionary relationships are captured in phylogenetic trees, multiple sequence alignments and statistical models (hidden Markov models or HMMs). Genes are classified according to their function in several different ways: families and subfamilies are annotated with ontology terms (Gene Ontology (GO) and PANTHER protein class), and sequences are assigned to PANTHER pathways. The PANTHER website includes a suite of tools that enable users to browse and query gene functions, and to analyze large-scale experimental data with a number of statistical tests. It is widely used by bench scientists, bioinformaticians, computer scientists and systems biologists. In the 2013 release of PANTHER (v.8.0), in addition to an update of the data content, we redesigned the website interface to improve both user experience and the system's analytical capability. This protocol provides a detailed description of how to analyze genome-wide experimental data with the PANTHER classification system.},

abstract = {Detection of genes known to be present on the mammalian Y chromosome was adapted for sexing mouse early embryos using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Sry and Zfy genes located in the sex-determining region of the Y chromosome were chosen for Y-specific target sequences, and DXNds3 sequence on the X chromosome was chosen for control. The two-step PCR method using two pairs of primers for each of the target sequences was employed for detecting the sequences. When DNAs of male and female mice were amplified with these primers, male-specific fragments were detected even in DNAs that were equivalent in amount to two cells. Mouse embryos at the two-cell stage were separated into two individual blastomeres, and one blastomere was karyotyped at the second cleavage. The remaining blastomere was subjected to PCR amplification immediately or after having been cultured for 48 h up to the morula stage. The Sry and Zfy sequences were detected in about half the embryos; detection of the Sry and Zfy sequences corresponded exactly to the presence of the Y chromosome, except in one sample of male morula in which embryos may have been lost before the PCR amplification. It is concluded that the sex of mouse preimplantation embryos can be accurately determined through detection of the Y-specific sequences using the two-step PCR method, even with the single blastomeres separated at the two-cell stage.},

@article{DeMiranda2010,
abstract = {Maternal infection during pregnancy with a wide range of RNA and DNA viruses is associated with increased risk for schizophrenia and autism in their offspring. A common feature in these exposures is that virus replication induces innate immunity through interaction with Toll-like receptors (TLRs). We employed a mouse model wherein pregnant mice were exposed to polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I C)], a synthetic, double-stranded RNA molecular mimic of replicating virus. Poly(I C) inhibited embryonic neuronal stem cell replication and population of the superficial layers of the neocortex by neurons. Poly(I C) also led to impaired neonatal locomotor development and abnormal sensorimotor gating responses in adult offspring. Using Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)-deficient mice, we established that these effects were dependent on TLR3. Inhibition of stem cell proliferation was also abrogated by pretreatment with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) carprofen, a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor. Our findings provide insights into mechanisms by which maternal infection can induce subtle neuropathology and behavioral dysfunction, and they may suggest strategies for reducing the risk of neuropsychiatric disorders subsequent to prenatal exposures to pathogens and other triggers of innate immunity.},

@article{Torrey1997,
abstract = {More than 250 studies, covering 29 Northern and five Southern Hemisphere countries, have been published on the birth seasonality of individuals who develop schizophrenia and/or bipolar disorder. Despite methodological problems, the studies are remarkably consistent in showing a 5-8{\%} winter-spring excess of births for both schizophrenia and mania/bipolar disorder. This seasonal birth excess is also found in schizoaffective disorder (December-March), major depression (March-May), and autism (March) but not in other psychiatric conditions with the possible exceptions of eating disorders and antisocial personality disorder. The seasonal birth pattern also may shift over time. Attempts to correlate the seasonal birth excess with specific features of schizophrenia suggest that winter-spring births are probably related to urban births and to a negative family history. Possible correlations include lesser severity of illness and neurophysiological measures. There appears to be no correlation with gender, social class, race, measurable pregnancy and birth complications, clinical subtypes, or neurological, neuropsychological, or neuroimaging measures. Virtually no correlation studies have been done for bipolar disorder. Regarding the cause of the birth seasonality, statistical artifact and parental procreational habits are unlikely explanations. Seasonal effects of genes, subtle pregnancy and birth complications, light and internal chemistry, toxins, nutrition, temperature/weather, and infectious agents or a combination of these are all viable possibilities.},

abstract = {Postmortem brain studies have shown deficits in the cortical gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system in schizophrenic individuals. Expression studies have shown a decrease in the major GABA-synthesizing enzyme (glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67) mRNA levels in neurons in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in schizophrenics relative to controls. In the present study, SNPs in and around the GAD1 gene, which encodes the protein GAD67, were tested on a rare, severely ill group of children and adolescents with childhood-onset schizophrenia (COS) (n=72), in a family-based association analysis. Compared to adult-onset samples, the COS sample has evidence for more salient familial, and perhaps genetic, risk factors for schizophrenia, as well as evidence for frontal cortical hypofunction, and greater decline in cortical gray matter volume on anatomic brain MRI scans during adolescence. We performed family-based TDT and haplotype association analyses of the clinical phenotype, as well as association analyses with endophenotypes using the QTDT program. Three adjacent SNPs in the 5' upstream region of GAD1 showed a positive pairwise association with illness in these families (P=0.022-0.057). Significant transmission distortion of 4-SNP haplotypes was also observed (P=0.003-0.008). Quantitative trait TDT analyses showed an intriguing association between several SNPs and increased rate of frontal gray matter loss. These observations, when taken together with the positive results reported recently in two independent adult-onset schizophrenia pedigree samples, suggest that the gene encoding GAD67 may be a common risk factor for schizophrenia.},

Three example protocols are given: using an mRNA sequence to identify the exon-intron locations and associated gene in the genomic sequence of the same species, using a protein sequence to identify the coding regions in a genomic sequence and to search for gene family members in the same species, and using a protein sequence to find homologs in another species.},

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) is a widely deployed transcriptome profiling and annotation technique, but questions about the performance of different protocols and platforms remain. We used a newly developed pool of 96 synthetic RNAs with various lengths, and GC content covering a 2(20) concentration range as spike-in controls to measure sensitivity, accuracy, and biases in RNA-seq experiments as well as to derive standard curves for quantifying the abundance of transcripts. We observed linearity between read density and RNA input over the entire detection range and excellent agreement between replicates, but we observed significantly larger imprecision than expected under pure Poisson sampling errors. We use the control RNAs to directly measure reproducible protocol-dependent biases due to GC content and transcript length as well as stereotypic heterogeneity in coverage across transcripts correlated with position relative to RNA termini and priming sequence bias. These effects lead to biased quantification for short transcripts and individual exons, which is a serious problem for measurements of isoform abundances, but that can partially be corrected using appropriate models of bias. By using the control RNAs, we derive limits for the discovery and detection of rare transcripts in RNA-seq experiments. By using data collected as part of the model organism and human Encyclopedia of DNA Elements projects (ENCODE and modENCODE), we demonstrate that external RNA controls are a useful resource for evaluating sensitivity and accuracy of RNA-seq experiments for transcriptome discovery and quantification. These quality metrics facilitate comparable analysis across different samples, protocols, and platforms.},

abstract = {Although the brain has classically been considered "immune-privileged", current research suggests an extensive communication between the immune and nervous systems in both health and disease. Recent studies demonstrate that immune molecules are present at the right place and time to modulate the development and function of the healthy and diseased central nervous system (CNS). Indeed, immune molecules play integral roles in the CNS throughout neural development, including affecting neurogenesis, neuronal migration, axon guidance, synapse formation, activity-dependent refinement of circuits, and synaptic plasticity. Moreover, the roles of individual immune molecules in the nervous system may change over development. This review focuses on the effects of immune molecules on neuronal connections in the mammalian central nervous system - specifically the roles for MHCI and its receptors, complement, and cytokines on the function, refinement, and plasticity of geniculate, cortical and hippocampal synapses, and their relationship to neurodevelopmental disorders. These functions for immune molecules during neural development suggest that they could also mediate pathological responses to chronic elevations of cytokines in neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maternal immune activation (MIA) during prenatal life is a risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders including schizophrenia and autism. Such conditions are associated with alterations in fronto-subcortical circuits, but their molecular basis is far from clear. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and mass spectrometry, with targeted western blot analyses for confirmation, we investigated the impact of MIA on the prefrontal and striatal proteome from an established MIA mouse model generated in C57B6 mice, by administering the viral analogue PolyI:C or saline vehicle (control) intravenously on gestation day (GD) 9. In striatum, 11 proteins were up-regulated and 4 proteins were down-regulated in the PolyI:C mice, while 10 proteins were up-regulated and 7 proteins down-regulated in prefrontal cortex (PFC). These were proteins involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, oxidation and auto-immune targets, including dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK), eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4A-II, creatine kinase (CK)-B, L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-B, WD repeat-containing protein and NADH dehydrogenase in the striatum; and guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein), 14-3-3 protein, alpha-enolase, olfactory maker protein and heat shock proteins (HSP) 60, and 90-beta in the PFC. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This data fits with emerging evidence for disruption of critical converging intracellular pathways involving MAPK pathways in neurodevelopmental conditions and it shows considerable overlap with protein pathways identified by genetic modeling and clinical post-mortem studies. This has implications for understanding causality and may offer potential biomarkers and novel treatment targets for neurodevelopmental conditions.},

abstract = {The brain contains numerous mononuclear phagocytes called microglia. These cells express the transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor for the macrophage growth factor colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1R). Using a CSF-1R-GFP reporter mouse strain combined with lineage defining antibody staining we show in the postnatal mouse brain that CSF-1R is expressed only in microglia and not neurons, astrocytes or glial cells. To study CSF-1R function we used mice homozygous for a null mutation in the Csflr gene. In these mice microglia are >99{\%} depleted at embryonic day 16 and day 1 post-partum brain. At three weeks of age this microglial depletion continues in most regions of the brain although some contain clusters of rounded microglia. Despite the loss of microglia, embryonic brain development appears normal but during the post-natal period the brain architecture becomes perturbed with enlarged ventricles and regionally compressed parenchyma, phenotypes most prominent in the olfactory bulb and cortex. In the cortex there is increased neuronal density, elevated numbers of astrocytes but reduced numbers of oligodendrocytes. Csf1r nulls rarely survive to adulthood and therefore to study the role of CSF-1R in olfaction we used the viable null mutants in the Csf1 (Csf1(op)) gene that encodes one of the two known CSF-1R ligands. Food-finding experiments indicate that olfactory capacity is significantly impaired in the absence of CSF-1. CSF-1R is therefore required for the development of microglia, for a fully functional olfactory system and the maintenance of normal brain structure.},

abstract = {Emerging evidence points to the involvement of the brain extracellular matrix (ECM) in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (SZ). Abnormalities affecting several ECM components, including Reelin and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), have been described in subjects with this disease. Solid evidence supports the involvement of Reelin, an ECM glycoprotein involved in corticogenesis, synaptic functions and glutamate NMDA receptor regulation, expressed prevalently in distinct populations of GABAergic neurons, which secrete it into the ECM. Marked changes of Reelin expression in SZ have typically been reported in association with GABA-related abnormalities in subjects with SZ and bipolar disorder. Recent findings from our group point to substantial abnormalities affecting CSPGs, a main ECM component, in the amygdala and entorhinal cortex of subjects with schizophrenia, but not bipolar disorder. Striking increases of glial cells expressing CSPGs were accompanied by reductions of perineuronal nets, CSPG- and Reelin-enriched ECM aggregates enveloping distinct neuronal populations. CSPGs developmental and adult functions, including neuronal migration, axon guidance, synaptic and neurotransmission regulation are highly relevant to the pathophysiology of SZ. Together with reports of anomalies affecting several other ECM components, these findings point to the ECM as a key component of the pathology of SZ. We propose that ECM abnormalities may contribute to several aspects of the pathophysiology of this disease, including disrupted connectivity and neuronal migration, synaptic anomalies and altered GABAergic, glutamatergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission.},

abstract = {Several lines of evidence support the theory of schizophrenia (SZ) being a neurodevelopmental disorder. The structural, cytoarchitectural and functional brain abnormalities reported in patients with SZ, might be due to aberrant neuronal migration, since the final position of neurons affects neuronal function, morphology, and formation of synaptic connections. We have investigated the putative association between SZ and gene variants engaged in the neuronal migration process, by performing an association study on 839 cases and 1,473 controls of Scandinavian origin. Using a gene-wide approach, tagSNPs in 18 candidate genes have been genotyped, with gene products involved in the neuron-to-glial cell adhesion, interactions with the DISC1 protein and/or rearrangements of the cytoskeleton. Of the 289 markers tested, 19 markers located in genes MDGA1, RELN, ITGA3, DLX1, SPARCL1, and ASTN1, attained nominal significant P-values (P < 0.05) in either a genotypic or allelic association test. All of these genes, except transcription factor DLX1, are involved in the adhesion between neurons and radial glial cells. Eight markers obtained nominal significance in both tests, and were located in intronic or 3'UTR regions of adhesion molecule MDGA1 and previously reported SZ candidate RELN. The most significant result was attained for MDGA1 SNP rs9462341 (unadjusted association results: genotypic P = 0.00095; allelic P = 0.010). Several haplotypes within MDGA1, RELN, ITGA3, and ENAH were nominally significant. Further studies in independent samples are needed, including upcoming genome wide association study results, but our data suggest that MDGA1 is a new SZ susceptibility gene, and that altered neuronal migration is involved in SZ pathology.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is characterized by complex gene expression changes. The transcriptome alterations in the prefrontal cortex have been the subject of several recent postmortem studies that yielded both convergent and divergent findings. METHODS: To increase measurement precision, we used a custom-designed DNA microarray platform with long oligonucleotides and multiple probes with replicates. The platform was designed to assess the expression of > 1800 genes specifically chosen because of their hypothesized roles in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The gene expression differences in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples from 14 matched pairs of schizophrenia and control subjects were analyzed with two technical replicates and four data mining approaches. RESULTS: In addition to replicating many expression changes in synaptic, oligodendrocyte, and signal transduction genes, we uncovered and validated a robust immune/chaperone transcript upregulation in the schizophrenia samples. CONCLUSIONS: We speculate that the overexpression of SERPINA3, IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3, CHI3L1, MT2A, CD14, HSPB1, HSPA1B, and HSPA1A in schizophrenia subjects represents a long-lasting and correlated signature of an early environmental insult during development that actively contributes to the pathophysiology of prefrontal dysfunction.},

abstract = {The dynamic impact approach (DIA) represents an alternative to overrepresentation analysis (ORA) for functional analysis of time-course experiments or those involving multiple treatments. The DIA can be used to estimate the biological impact of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with particular biological functions, for example, as represented by the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) annotations. However, the DIA does not take into account the correlated dependence structure of the KEGG pathway hierarchy. We have developed herein a path analysis model (KEGG-PATH) to subdivide the total effect of each KEGG pathway into the direct effect and indirect effect by taking into account not only each KEGG pathway itself, but also the correlation with its related pathways. In addition, this work also attempts to preliminarily estimate the impact direction of each KEGG pathway by a gradient analysis method from principal component analysis (PCA). As a result, the advantage of the KEGG-PATH model is demonstrated through the functional analysis of the bovine mammary transcriptome during lactation.},

abstract = {Impaired glucose metabolism and the development of metabolic syndrome contribute to a reduction in the average life expectancy of individuals with schizophrenia. It is unclear whether this association simply reflects an unhealthy lifestyle or whether weight gain and impaired glucose tolerance in patients with schizophrenia are directly attributable to the side effects of atypical antipsychotic medications or disease-inherent derangements. In addition, numerous previous studies have highlighted alterations in the immune system of patients with schizophrenia. Increased concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) appear to be state markers, whereas IL-12, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) appear to be trait markers of schizophrenia. Moreover, the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) and microglial activation are involved in the early course of the disease. This review illustrates a "chicken-egg dilemma", as it is currently unclear whether impaired cerebral glucose utilization leads to secondary disturbances in peripheral glucose metabolism, an increased risk of cardiovascular complications, and accompanying pro-inflammatory changes in patients with schizophrenia or whether immune mechanisms may be involved in the initial pathogenesis of schizophrenia, which leads to disturbances in glucose metabolism such as metabolic syndrome. Alternatively, shared underlying factors may be responsible for the co-occurrence of immune system and glucose metabolism disturbances in schizophrenia.},

@article{Akbarian1995,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Up-regulation of gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptors and decreased GABA uptake in the cerebral cortex of schizophrenics suggest altered GABAergic transmission, which could be caused by primary disturbance of GABA synapses or by decreased production of the transmitter. Decreased production could be due to a shutdown in GABA production or to loss of GABA neurons caused by cell death or their failure to migrate to the cortex during brain development. METHODS: To discriminate between these possibilities, we quantified levels of messenger RNA (mRNA) for the 67-kd isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the key enzyme in GABA synthesis, and the number and laminar distribution of GAD mRNA--expressing neurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of schizophrenics and matched controls, using in situ hybridization-histochemistry, densitometry, and cell-counting methods. These data were compared with the total number of neurons, the number of small, round or ovoid neurons 8 to 15 microns in diameter, and overall frontal lobe volume. As a control, mRNA levels for type II calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CamIIK) were quantified. RESULTS: Schizophrenics showed a pronounced decrease in GAD mRNA levels in neurons of layer I (40{\%}) and layer II (48{\%}) and an overall 30{\%} decrease in layers III to VI. There were also strong overall reductions in GAD mRNA levels. The CamIIK mRNA levels showed no significant differences between samples. No differences were found in the total number of neurons nor in small, round or ovoid neurons, which should include a majority of the GABA cells. Prefrontal gray and white matter volume did not differ significantly between controls and schizophrenics. CONCLUSIONS: The prefrontal cortex of schizophrenics shows reduced expression for GAD in the absence of significant cell loss. This may be brought about by an activity-dependent down-regulation associated with the functional hypoactivity of the DLPFC. The lack of significant alterations in cell numbers in the DLPFC and frontal lobe volume in schizophrenics also implies that overall cortical neuronal migration had not been compromised in development. Previous reports of altered neuronal distribution in the subcortical white matter of schizophrenic brains in comparison with that of controls may indicate disturbances of migration or programmed cell death in the cortical subplate, leading to altered connection formation in the overlying cortex of schizophrenics and activity-dependent down-regulation of neurotransmitter-related gene expression.},

abstract = {We have discovered DEGA, a novel cDNA differentially expressed in human gastric adenocarcinomas. The DEGA gene product contains a signal peptide, five leucine-rich repeat motifs and a single IgG, and transmembrane domain, suggesting its residence on the plasma membrane. Transfection of 293 cells with a DEGA-GFP fusion construct confirmed its cell surface localization. Although the cytosolic portion of the DEGA gene product does not contain known protein domains, approximately one-fifth of these residues are either a serine or a threonine, suggesting that DEGA may play a role in signal transduction. BLAST searches revealed DEGA to be an exact match to AMIGO-2, a recently identified, but functionally uncharacterized protein related to AMIGO, a leucine-rich repeat containing cell adhesion molecule implicated in axon tract development. In this report, we show that DEGA/AMIGO-2 mRNA is differentially expressed in approximately 45{\%} of tumor versus normal tissue from gastric adenocarcinoma patients. Stable expression of a DEGA/AMIGO-2 antisense construct in the gastric adenocarcinoma cell line, AGS, led to altered morphology, increased ploidy, chromosomal instability, decreased cell adhesion/migration, and a nearly complete abrogation of tumorigenicity in nude mice. These findings suggest a potential etiologic role for DEGA/AMIGO-2 in gastric adenocarcinoma.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Disruption of foetal development by prenatal maternal infection is consistent with a neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia. Whether specific prenatal infections are involved, their timing and the mechanisms of any effect are all unknown. We addressed these questions through a systematic review of population-based studies. METHOD: Electronic and manual searches and rigorous quality assessment yielded 21 studies that included an objective assessment of individual-level prenatal maternal infection and standardized psychotic diagnoses in adult offspring. Methodological differences between studies necessitated a descriptive review. RESULTS: Results for prenatal maternal non-specific bacterial, respiratory or genital and reproductive infection differed between studies, which reported up to a two- to fivefold increased risk of schizophrenia. Evidence for herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and Toxoplasma gondii was mixed; some studies reported up to a doubling of schizophrenia risk. Prenatal HSV-1 or cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections were not associated with increased risk. Exposure to influenza or other infections during early pregnancy may be more harmful than later exposure. Increased proinflammatory cytokines during pregnancy were also associated with risk. Prenatal infection was associated with structural and functional brain abnormalities relevant to schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal exposure to a range of infections and inflammatory responses may be associated with risk of adult schizophrenia. Larger samples, mediation and animal models should be used to investigate whether there is a 'sensitive period' during development, and the effects of prenatal infections on neurodevelopment. Inclusion of genetic and immunological information should help to elucidate to what extent genetic vulnerability to schizophrenia may be explained by vulnerability to infection.},

abstract = {The development of GABAergic inhibitory circuits is shaped by neural activity, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we demonstrate a novel function of GABA in regulating GABAergic innervation in the adolescent brain, when GABA is mainly known as an inhibitory transmitter. Conditional knockdown of the rate-limiting synthetic enzyme GAD67 in basket interneurons in adolescent visual cortex resulted in cell autonomous deficits in axon branching, perisomatic synapse formation around pyramidal neurons, and complexity of the innervation fields; the same manipulation had little influence on the subsequent maintenance of perisomatic synapses. These effects of GABA deficiency were rescued by suppressing GABA reuptake and by GABA receptor agonists. Germline knockdown of GAD67 but not GAD65 showed similar deficits, suggesting a specific role of GAD67 in the maturation of perisomatic innervation. Since intracellular GABA levels are modulated by neuronal activity, our results implicate GAD67-mediated GABA synthesis in activity-dependent regulation of inhibitory innervation patterns.},

abstract = {Comparisons of gene expression between human and non-human primate brains have identified hundreds of differentially expressed genes, yet translating these lists into key functional distinctions between species has proved difficult. Here we provide a more integrated view of human brain evolution by examining the large-scale organization of gene coexpression networks in human and chimpanzee brains. We identify modules of coexpressed genes that correspond to discrete brain regions and quantify their conservation between the species. Module conservation in cerebral cortex is significantly weaker than module conservation in subcortical brain regions, revealing a striking gradient that parallels known evolutionary hierarchies. We introduce a method for identifying species-specific network connections and demonstrate how differential network connectivity can be used to identify key drivers of evolutionary change. By integrating our results with comparative genomic sequence data and estimates of protein sequence divergence rates, we confirm a number of network predictions and validate these findings. Our results provide insights into the molecular bases of primate brain organization and demonstrate the general utility of weighted gene coexpression network analysis.},

In addition, we show that CXCR4 is present in early generated Cajal-Retzius cells of the cortical marginal zone. In mice with a null mutation in CXCR4 or SDF-1, interneurons were severely underrepresented in the superficial layers and ectopically placed in the deep layers of the neocortex. In contrast, the submeningeal positioning of Cajal-Retzius cells was unaffected. Thus, our findings suggest that SDF-1, which is highly expressed in the embryonic leptomeninx, selectively regulates migration and layer-specific integration of CXCR4-expressing interneurons during neocortical development.},

Gene expression disturbances in the brain of subjects with schizophrenia show complex, region-specific changes with consistently replicated and potentially interdependent induction of serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade A member 3 (SERPINA3) and interferon inducible transmembrane protein (IFITM) family transcripts in the prefrontal cortex. Recent data suggest that IFITM3 expression is a critical mediator of maternal immune activation. Because the IFITM gene family is primarily expressed in the endothelial cells and meninges, and because the meninges play a critical role in interneuron development, we suggest that these two non-neuronal cell populations might play an important role in the disease pathophysiology. Finally, we propose that IFITM3 in particular might be a novel, appealing, knowledge-based drug target for treatment of schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Microglia with increased expression of the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR; c-fms) are found surrounding plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in mouse models for AD and after ischemic or traumatic brain injury. Increased expression of M-CSFR causes microglia to adopt an activated state that results in proliferation, release of cytokines, and enhanced phagocytosis. To determine whether M-CSFR-induced microglial activation affects neuronal survival, we assembled a coculture system consisting of BV-2 microglia transfected to overexpress the M-CSFR and hippocampal organotypic slices treated with NMDA. Twenty-four hours after assembly of the coculture, microglia overexpressing M-CSFR proliferated at a higher rate than nontransfected control cells and exhibited enhanced migration toward NMDA-injured hippocampal cultures. Surprisingly, coculture with c-fms-transfected microglia resulted in a dramatic reduction in NMDA-induced neurotoxicity. Similar results were observed when cocultures were treated with the teratogen cyclophosphamide. Biolistic overexpression of M-CSFR on microglia endogenous to the organotypic culture also rescued neurons from excitotoxicity. Furthermore, c-fms-transfected microglia increased neuronal expression of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), the M-CSFR, and neurotrophin receptors in the NMDA-treated slices, as determined with laser capture microdissection. In the coculture system, direct contact between the exogenous microglia and the slice was necessary for neuroprotection. Finally, blocking expression of the M-CSF ligand by exogenous c-fms-transfected microglia with a hammerhead ribozyme compromised their neuroprotective properties. These results demonstrate a protective role for microglia overexpressing M-CSFR in our coculture system and suggest under certain circumstances, activated microglia can help rather than harm neurons subjected to excitotoxic and teratogen-induced injury.},

abstract = {The production of adult-born neurons is an ongoing process accounting for > 10,000 immature neurons migrating to the olfactory bulb every day. This high turnover rate necessitates profound control mechanisms converging onto neural stem cells and neuroblasts to achieve adequate adult-born neuron production. Here, we elaborate on a novel epigenetic control of adult neurogenesis via highly coordinated, non-synaptic, intercellular signalling. This communication engages the neurotransmitters GABA and glutamate, whose extracellular concentrations depend on neuroblast number and high affinity uptake systems in stem cells. Previous studies show that neuroblasts release GABA providing a negative feedback control of stem cell proliferation. Recent findings show an unexpected mosaic expression of glutamate receptors leading to calcium elevations in migrating neuroblasts. We speculate that stem cells release glutamate that activates glutamate receptors on migrating neuroblasts providing them with migratory and survival cues. In addition, we propose that the timing of neurotransmitter release and their spatial diffusion will determine the convergent coactivation of neuroblasts and stem cells, and provide a steady-state level of neuroblast production. Upon external impact or injury this signalling may adjust to a new steady-state level, thus providing non-synaptic scaling of neuroblast production.},

abstract = {Whole-genome association studies (WGAS) bring new computational, as well as analytic, challenges to researchers. Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.},

abstract = {For more than a century, clinical investigators have focused on early life as a source of adult psychopathology. Early theories about psychic conflict and toxic parenting have been replaced by more recent formulations of complex interactions of genes and environment. Although the hypothesized mechanisms have evolved, a central notion remains: early life is a period of unique sensitivity during which experience confers enduring effects. The mechanisms for these effects remain almost as much a mystery today as they were a century ago. Recent studies suggest that maternal diet can program offspring growth and metabolic pathways, altering lifelong susceptibility to diabetes and obesity. If maternal psychosocial experience has similar programming effects on the developing offspring, one might expect a comparable contribution to neurodevelopmental disorders, including affective disorders, schizophrenia, autism, and eating disorders. Due to their early onset, prevalence, and chronicity, some of these disorders, such as depression and schizophrenia, are among the highest causes of disability worldwide according to the World Health Organization 2002 report. Consideration of the early life programming and transcriptional regulation in adult exposures supports a critical need to understand epigenetic mechanisms as a critical determinant in disease predisposition. Incorporating the latest insight gained from clinical and epidemiological studies with potential epigenetic mechanisms from basic research, the following review summarizes findings from a workshop on Early Life Programming and Neurodevelopmental Disorders held at the University of Pennsylvania in 2009.},

abstract = {The ability to measure gene expression on a genome-wide scale is one of the most promising accomplishments in molecular biology. Microarrays, the technology that first permitted this, were riddled with problems due to unwanted sources of variability. Many of these problems are now mitigated, after a decade's worth of statistical methodology development. The recently developed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology has generated much excitement in part due to claims of reduced variability in comparison to microarrays. However, we show that RNA-seq data demonstrate unwanted and obscuring variability similar to what was first observed in microarrays. In particular, we find guanine-cytosine content (GC-content) has a strong sample-specific effect on gene expression measurements that, if left uncorrected, leads to false positives in downstream results. We also report on commonly observed data distortions that demonstrate the need for data normalization. Here, we describe a statistical methodology that improves precision by 42{\%} without loss of accuracy. Our resulting conditional quantile normalization algorithm combines robust generalized regression to remove systematic bias introduced by deterministic features such as GC-content and quantile normalization to correct for global distortions.},

Convergent findings indicate that a deficiency in signalling through the TrkB neurotrophin receptor leads to reduced GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) synthesis in the parvalbumin-containing subpopulation of inhibitory GABA neurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of individuals with schizophrenia. Despite both pre- and postsynaptic compensatory responses, the resulting alteration in perisomatic inhibition of pyramidal neurons contributes to a diminished capacity for the gamma-frequency synchronized neuronal activity that is required for working memory function. These findings reveal specific targets for therapeutic interventions to improve cognitive function in individuals with schizophrenia.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reelin (RELN) is a glycoprotein secreted preferentially by cortical gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic (GABAergic) interneurons (layers I and II) that binds to integrin receptors located on dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons or on GABAergic interneurons of layers III through V expressing the disabled-1 gene product (DAB1), a cytosolic adaptor protein that mediates RELN action. To replicate earlier findings that RELN and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)(67), but not DAB1 expression, are down-regulated in schizophrenic brains, and to verify whether other psychiatric disorders express similar deficits, we analyzed, blind, an entirely new cohort of 60 postmortem brains, including equal numbers of patients matched for schizophrenia, unipolar depression, and bipolar disorder with nonpsychiatric subjects. METHODS: Reelin, GAD(65), GAD(67), DAB1, and neuron-specific-enolase messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and respective proteins were measured with quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or Western blot analyses. Reelin-positive neurons were identified by immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal antibody. RESULTS: Prefrontal cortex and cerebellar expression of RELN mRNA, GAD(67) protein and mRNA, and prefrontal cortex RELN-positive cells was significantly decreased by 30{\%} to 50{\%} in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder with psychosis, but not in those with unipolar depression without psychosis when compared with nonpsychiatric subjects. Group differences were absent for DAB1,GAD(65) and neuron-specific-enolase expression implying that RELN and GAD(67) down-regulations were unrelated to neuronal damage. Reelin and GAD(67) were also unrelated to postmortem intervals, dose, duration, or presence of antipsychotic medication. CONCLUSIONS: The selective down-regulation of RELN and GAD(67) in prefrontal cortex of patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder who have psychosis is consistent with the hypothesis that these parameters are vulnerability factors in psychosis; this plus the loss of the correlation between these 2 parameters that exists in nonpsychotic subjects support the hypothesis that these changes may be liability factors underlying psychosis.},

@article{Miller2010,
abstract = {Because mouse models play a crucial role in biomedical research related to the human nervous system, understanding the similarities and differences between mouse and human brain is of fundamental importance. Studies comparing transcription in human and mouse have come to varied conclusions, in part because of their relatively small sample sizes or underpowered methodologies. To better characterize gene expression differences between mouse and human, we took a systems-biology approach by using weighted gene coexpression network analysis on more than 1,000 microarrays from brain. We find that global network properties of the brain transcriptome are highly preserved between species. Furthermore, all modules of highly coexpressed genes identified in mouse were identified in human, with those related to conserved cellular functions showing the strongest between-species preservation. Modules corresponding to glial and neuronal cells were sufficiently preserved between mouse and human to permit identification of cross species cell-class marker genes. We also identify several robust human-specific modules, including one strongly correlated with measures of Alzheimer disease progression across multiple data sets, whose hubs are poorly-characterized genes likely involved in Alzheimer disease. We present multiple lines of evidence suggesting links between neurodegenerative disease and glial cell types in human, including human-specific correlation of presenilin-1 with oligodendrocyte markers, and significant enrichment for known neurodegenerative disease genes in microglial modules. Together, this work identifies convergent and divergent pathways in mouse and human, and provides a systematic framework that will be useful for understanding the applicability of mouse models for human brain disorders.},

We note here an emerging group of central nervous system-enriched, type I surface proteins with an ectodomain containing LRR repeats and motifs found in cell adhesion molecules. Members of this group include the Amphoterin-induced gene and ORF-1 (AMIGO-1), LRR and Ig domain containing Nogo Receptor interacting protein I (LINGO-1) and the netrin-G1 ligand NGL-1. The above proteins carry, in addition to the LRR repeats, an immunoglobin (Ig)-like segment in their ectodomain. Two other related families of molecules, the NLRRs and the FLRTs, have in addition, a fibronectin type III repeat. The LRR domain distinguishes these molecules from the more extensively studied Ig-like family of cell adhesion molecules, and the transmembrane domain differentiate them from the family of secreted extracellular proteoglycans with LRRs. Functionally, many members of this group of proteins could modulate neurite outgrowth of neurons, at least in vitro. LINGO-1, initially discovered as a component of the Nogo-66 receptor complex which inhibits neurite growth, also regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. Current knowledge and recent findings pertaining to the functions of this interesting group of proteins in the nervous system are discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A converging body of evidence implicates the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter system in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. METHODS: The authors review neuroscience literature and clinical studies investigating the role of the GABA system in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. First, a background on the GABA system is provided, including GABA pharmacology and neuroanatomy of GABAergic neurons. Results from basic science schizophrenia animal models and human studies are reviewed. The role of GABA in cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia is then presented, followed by a discussion of GABAergic compounds used in monotherapy or adjunctively in clinical schizophrenia studies. RESULTS: In basic studies, reductions in GABAergic neuronal density and abnormalities in receptors and reuptake sites have been identified in several cortical and subcortical GABA systems. A model has been developed suggesting GABA's role (including GABA-dopamine interactions) in schizophrenia. In several clinical studies, the use of adjunctive GABA agonists was associated with greater improvement in core schizophrenia symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in the GABA neurotransmitter system are found in clinical and basic neuroscience schizophrenia studies as well as animal models and may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The interaction of GABA with other well-characterized neurotransmitter abnormalities remains to be understood. Future studies should elucidate the potential therapeutic role for GABA ligands in schizophrenia treatment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multi-genome comparative analysis has yielded important insights into the molecular details of gene regulation. We have developed EvoPrinter, a web-accessed genomics tool that provides a single uninterrupted view of conserved sequences as they appear in a species of interest. An EvoPrint reveals with near base-pair resolution those sequences that are essential for gene function. RESULTS: We describe here EvoPrinterHD, a 2nd-generation comparative genomics tool that automatically generates from a single input sequence an enhanced view of sequence conservation between evolutionarily distant species. Currently available for 5 nematode, 3 mosquito, 12 Drosophila, 20 vertebrate, 17 Staphylococcus and 20 enteric bacteria genomes, EvoPrinterHD employs a modified BLAT algorithm [enhanced-BLAT (eBLAT)], which detects up to 75{\%} more conserved bases than identified by the BLAT alignments used in the earlier EvoPrinter program. The new program also identifies conserved sequences within rearranged DNA, highlights repetitive DNA, and detects sequencing gaps. EvoPrinterHD currently holds over 112 billion bp of indexed genomes in memory and has the flexibility of selecting a subset of genomes for analysis. An EvoDifferences profile is also generated to portray conserved sequences that are uniquely lost in any one of the orthologs. Finally, EvoPrinterHD incorporates options that allow for (1) re-initiation of the analysis using a different genome's aligning region as the reference DNA to detect species-specific changes in less-conserved regions, (2) rapid extraction and curation of conserved sequences, and (3) for bacteria, identifies unique or uniquely shared sequences present in subsets of genomes. CONCLUSION: EvoPrinterHD is a fast, high-resolution comparative genomics tool that automatically generates an uninterrupted species-centric view of sequence conservation and enables the discovery of conserved sequences within rearranged DNA. When combined with cis-Decoder, a program that discovers sequence elements shared among tissue specific enhancers, EvoPrinterHD facilitates the analysis of conserved sequences that are essential for coordinate gene regulation.},

abstract = {In order to investigate a possible relationship between schizophrenic births and viral diseases, the birth month and year of all state hospital admissions for schizophrenia in Connecticut and Massachusetts from 1973-1974 were compared with the occurrence of reportable viral diseases for 1920-1955. Data was statistically examined by time series using spectral analysis. Statistically significant coherences were found between schizophrenic births and measles (both states), varicella-zoster (Connecticut) and polio (Connecticut). Influenza just missed statistical significance. No temporal relationship between schizophrenic births and rubella or mumps was found. The results are compared with similar studies in Minnesota and Finland. Definitive explanations for the observed relationships are precluded by the emerging complexity of virus-CNS interactions. A triggering of immune dysfunction by the infectious agents is proposed as the most reasonable explanation.},

abstract = {Gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA(A)) receptors are ligand-gated ion channels responsible for mediation of fast inhibitory action of GABA in the brain. Preliminary reports have demonstrated altered expression of GABA receptors in the brains of subjects with autism suggesting GABA/glutamate system dysregulation. We investigated the expression of four GABA(A) receptor subunits and observed significant reductions in GABRA1, GABRA2, GABRA3, and GABRB3 in parietal cortex (Brodmann's Area 40 (BA40)), while GABRA1 and GABRB3 were significantly altered in cerebellum, and GABRA1 was significantly altered in superior frontal cortex (BA9). The presence of seizure disorder did not have a significant impact on GABA(A) receptor subunit expression in the three brain areas. Our results demonstrate that GABA(A) receptors are reduced in three brain regions that have previously been implicated in the pathogenesis of autism, suggesting widespread GABAergic dysfunction in the brains of subjects with autism.},

@article{Gan2004,
abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, dystrophic neurites, and reactive glial cells. Activated microglia are found to be intimately associated with senile plaques and may play a central role in mediating chronic inflammatory conditions in Alzheimer's disease. Activation of cultured murine microglial BV2 cells by freshly sonicated Abeta42 results in the secretion of neurotoxic factors that kill primary cultured neurons. To understand molecular pathways underlying Abeta-induced microglial activation, we analyzed the expression levels of transcripts isolated from Abeta42-activated BV2 cells using high density filter arrays. The analysis of these arrays identified 554 genes that are transcriptionally up-regulated by Abeta42 in a statistically significant manner. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was used to confirm the regulation of a subset of genes, including cysteine proteases cathepsin B and cathepsin L, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 2, cytochrome c oxidase, and allograft inflammatory factor 1. Small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of the cathepsin B gene in Abeta-activated BV2 cells diminished the microglial activation-mediated neurotoxicity. Moreover, CA-074, a specific cathepsin B inhibitor, also abolished the neurotoxic effects caused by Abeta42-activated BV2 cells. Our results suggest an essential role for secreted cathepsin B in neuronal death mediated by Abeta-activated inflammatory response.},
