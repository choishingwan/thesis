abstract = {Neurons have highly developed Ca(2+) signalling systems responsible for regulating many neural functions such as the generation of brain rhythms, information processing and the changes in synaptic plasticity that underpins learning and memory. The signalling mechanisms that regulate neuronal excitability are particularly important for processes such as sensory perception, cognition and consciousness. The Ca(2+) signalling pathway is a key component of the mechanisms responsible for regulating neuronal excitability, information processing and cognition. Alterations in gene transcription are particularly important as they result in subtle alterations in the neuronal signalling mechanisms that have been implicated in many neural diseases. In particular, dysregulation of the Ca(2+) signalling pathway has been implicated in the development of some of the major psychiatric diseases such as bipolar disorder (BPD) and schizophrenia.},

@article{Kapur2003,
abstract = {A review of the history of antipsychotics reveals that while the therapeutic effects of chlorpromazine and reserpine were discovered and actively researched almost concurrently, subsequent drug development has been restricted to drugs acting on postsynaptic receptors rather than modulation of dopamine release. The fundamental property of atypical antipsychotics is their ability to produce an antipsychotic effect in the absence of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) or prolactin elevation. Modulation of the dopamine D2 receptor remains both necessary and sufficient for antipsychotic drug action, with affinity to the D2-receptor being the single most important discriminator between a typical and atypical drug profile. Most antipsychotics, including atypical antipsychotics, show a dose-dependent threshold of D2 receptor occupancy for their therapeutic effects, although the precise threshold is different for different drugs. Some atypical antipsychotics do not appear to reach the threshold for EPS and prolactin elevation, possibly accounting for their atypical nature. To link the biological theories of antipsychotics to their psychological effects, a hypothesis is proposed wherein psychosis is a state of aberrant salience of stimuli and ideas, and antipsychotics, via modulation of the mesolimbic dopamine system, dampen the salience of these symptoms. Thus, antipsychotics do not excise psychosis: they provide the neurochemical platform for the resolution of symptoms. Future generations of antipsychotics may need to move away from a "one-size-fits-all polypharmacy-in-a-pill" approach to treat all the different aspects of schizophrenia. At least in theory a preferred approach would be the development of specific treatments for the different dimensions of schizophrenia (e.g., positive, negative, cognitive, and affective) that can be flexibly used and titrated in the service of patients' presenting psychopathology.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding individual differences in the development of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) as a response to antipsychotic therapy is essential to individualize treatment. METHODS: We performed genomewide association studies to search for genetic susceptibility to EPS. Our sample consisted of 738 schizophrenia patients, genotyped for 492K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We studied three quantitative measures of antipsychotic adverse drug reactions-the Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) for Parkinsonism, the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale, and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS)-as well as a clinical diagnosis of probable tardive dyskinesia. RESULTS: Two SNPs for SAS, rs17022444 and rs2126709 with p = 1.2 x 10(-10) and p = 3.8 x 10(-7), respectively, and one for AIMS, rs7669317 with p = 7.7 x 10(-8), reached genomewide significance (Q value < .1). rs17022444 and rs7669317 were located in intergenic regions and rs2126709 was located in ZNF202 on 11q24. Fourteen additional signals were potentially interesting (Q value < .5). The ZNF202 is a transcriptional repressor controlling, among other genes, PLP1, which is the major protein in myelin. Mutations in PLP1 cause Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, which has Parkinsonism as an occurring symptom. Altered mRNA expression of PLP1 is associated with schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: Although our findings require replication and validation, this study demonstrates the potential of genomewide association studies to discover genes and pathways that mediate adverse effects of antipsychotics.},

abstract = {RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) has rapidly become a popular tool to characterize transcriptomes. A fundamental research problem in many RNA-seq studies is the identification of reliable molecular markers that show differential expression between distinct sample groups. Together with the growing popularity of RNA-seq, a number of data analysis methods and pipelines have already been developed for this task. Currently, however, there is no clear consensus about the best practices yet, which makes the choice of an appropriate method a daunting task especially for a basic user without a strong statistical or computational background. To assist the choice, we perform here a systematic comparison of eight widely used software packages and pipelines for detecting differential expression between sample groups in a practical research setting and provide general guidelines for choosing a robust pipeline. In general, our results demonstrate how the data analysis tool utilized can markedly affect the outcome of the data analysis, highlighting the importance of this choice.},

abstract = {It is well established that autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have a strong genetic component; however, for at least 70{\%} of cases, the underlying genetic cause is unknown. Under the hypothesis that de novo mutations underlie a substantial fraction of the risk for developing ASD in families with no previous history of ASD or related phenotypes--so-called sporadic or simplex families--we sequenced all coding regions of the genome (the exome) for parent-child trios exhibiting sporadic ASD, including 189 new trios and 20 that were previously reported. Additionally, we also sequenced the exomes of 50 unaffected siblings corresponding to these new (n = 31) and previously reported trios (n = 19), for a total of 677 individual exomes from 209 families. Here we show that de novo point mutations are overwhelmingly paternal in origin (4:1 bias) and positively correlated with paternal age, consistent with the modest increased risk for children of older fathers to develop ASD. Moreover, 39{\%} (49 of 126) of the most severe or disruptive de novo mutations map to a highly interconnected beta-catenin/chromatin remodelling protein network ranked significantly for autism candidate genes. In proband exomes, recurrent protein-altering mutations were observed in two genes: CHD8 and NTNG1. Mutation screening of six candidate genes in 1,703 ASD probands identified additional de novo, protein-altering mutations in GRIN2B, LAMC3 and SCN1A. Combined with copy number variant (CNV) data, these results indicate extreme locus heterogeneity but also provide a target for future discovery, diagnostics and therapeutics.},

In addition, the paper reviews the findings suggesting that Ca(2+) is capable of inducing structural and cognitive deficits seen in schizophrenia. The evidence of the ability of antipsychotic drugs to affect Ca(2+) signaling is also presented. Based on these data, it is proposed that altered Ca(2+) signaling may constitute the central unifying molecular pathology in schizophrenia. According to this hypothesis schizophrenia can result from alterations in multiple proteins and other molecules as long as these alterations lead to abnormalities in certain key aspects of intracellular Ca(2+) signaling cascades.},

abstract = {The impact of the group B streptococcus (GBS)-induced maternal inflammation on offspring's brain has not yet been investigated despite GBS being one of the most frequent bacteria colonizing or infecting pregnant women. According to our hypothesis GBS-induced maternal immune activation plays a role in offspring perinatal brain damage and subsequent neurodisabilities such as autism. Using a new preclinical rat model of maternal inflammation triggered by inactivated GBS, we demonstrated placental, neuropathological and behavioral impacts on offspring. GBS-exposed placentas presented cystic lesions and polymorphonuclear infiltration located within the decidual/maternal side of the placenta, contrasting with macrophagic infiltration and necrotic areas located in the labyrinth/fetal compartment of the placenta after lipopolysaccharide-induced maternal inflammation. Brain damage featured lateral ventricles widening, predominately in the male, reduction of periventricular external capsules thickness, oligodendrocyte loss, and disorganization of frontoparietal subcortical tissue with no glial proliferation. Autistic hallmarks were found in offspring exposed to GBS, namely deficits in motor behavior, social and communicative impairments, i.e. profound defects in the integration and response to both acoustic and chemical signals that are predominant modes of communication in rats. Surprisingly, only male offspring were affected by these combined autistic-like traits. Our results show for the first time that materno-fetal inflammatory response to GBS plays a role in the induction of placental and cerebral insults, remarkably recapitulating cardinal features of human autism such as gender dichotomy and neurobehavioral traits. Unlike other models of prenatal inflammatory brain damage (induced by viral/toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) or Gram-negative/TLR4), maternal inflammation resulting from GBS/TLR2 interactions induced a distinctive pattern of chorioamnionitis and cerebral injuries. These results also provide important evidence that beyond genetic influences, modifiable environmental factors play a role in both the occurrence of autism and its gender imbalance.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Even though real-time PCR has been broadly applied in biomedical sciences, data processing procedures for the analysis of quantitative real-time PCR are still lacking; specifically in the realm of appropriate statistical treatment. Confidence interval and statistical significance considerations are not explicit in many of the current data analysis approaches. Based on the standard curve method and other useful data analysis methods, we present and compare four statistical approaches and models for the analysis of real-time PCR data. RESULTS: In the first approach, a multiple regression analysis model was developed to derive DeltaDeltaCt from estimation of interaction of gene and treatment effects. In the second approach, an ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) model was proposed, and the DeltaDeltaCt can be derived from analysis of effects of variables. The other two models involve calculation DeltaCt followed by a two group t-test and non-parametric analogous Wilcoxon test. SAS programs were developed for all four models and data output for analysis of a sample set are presented. In addition, a data quality control model was developed and implemented using SAS. CONCLUSION: Practical statistical solutions with SAS programs were developed for real-time PCR data and a sample dataset was analyzed with the SAS programs. The analysis using the various models and programs yielded similar results. Data quality control and analysis procedures presented here provide statistical elements for the estimation of the relative expression of genes using real-time PCR.},

abstract = {Multiple studies have confirmed the contribution of rare de novo copy number variations to the risk for autism spectrum disorders. But whereas de novo single nucleotide variants have been identified in affected individuals, their contribution to risk has yet to be clarified. Specifically, the frequency and distribution of these mutations have not been well characterized in matched unaffected controls, and such data are vital to the interpretation of de novo coding mutations observed in probands. Here we show, using whole-exome sequencing of 928 individuals, including 200 phenotypically discordant sibling pairs, that highly disruptive (nonsense and splice-site) de novo mutations in brain-expressed genes are associated with autism spectrum disorders and carry large effects. On the basis of mutation rates in unaffected individuals, we demonstrate that multiple independent de novo single nucleotide variants in the same gene among unrelated probands reliably identifies risk alleles, providing a clear path forward for gene discovery. Among a total of 279 identified de novo coding mutations, there is a single instance in probands, and none in siblings, in which two independent nonsense variants disrupt the same gene, SCN2A (sodium channel, voltage-gated, type II, alpha subunit), a result that is highly unlikely by chance.},

abstract = {The ubiquitously expressed serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase-1 (SGK1) is genomically regulated by cell stress (including cell shrinkage) and several hormones (including gluco- and mineralocorticoids). SGK1 is activated by insulin and growth factors through PI3K and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase PDK1. SGK1 activates a wide variety of ion channels (e.g., ENaC, SCN5A, TRPV4-6, ROMK, Kv1.3, Kv1.5, Kv4.3, KCNE1/KCNQ1, KCNQ4, ASIC1, GluR6, ClCKa/barttin, ClC2, CFTR, and Orai/STIM), which participate in the regulation of transport, hormone release, neuroexcitability, inflammation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. SGK1-sensitive ion channels participate in the regulation of renal Na(+) retention and K(+) elimination, blood pressure, gastric acid secretion, cardiac action potential, hemostasis, and neuroexcitability. A common ( approximately 3-5{\%} prevalence in Caucasians and approximately 10{\%} in Africans) SGK1 gene variant is associated with increased blood pressure and body weight as well as increased prevalence of type II diabetes and stroke. SGK1 further contributes to the pathophysiology of allergy, peptic ulcer, fibrosing disease, ischemia, tumor growth, and neurodegeneration. The effect of SGK1 on channel activity is modest, and the channels do not require SGK1 for basic function. SGK1-dependent ion channel regulation may thus become pathophysiologically relevant primarily after excessive (pathological) expression. Therefore, SGK1 may be considered an attractive therapeutic target despite its broad range of functions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since the inception of the GO annotation project, a variety of tools have been developed that support exploring and searching the GO database. In particular, a variety of tools that perform GO enrichment analysis are currently available. Most of these tools require as input a target set of genes and a background set and seek enrichment in the target set compared to the background set. A few tools also exist that support analyzing ranked lists. The latter typically rely on simulations or on union-bound correction for assigning statistical significance to the results. RESULTS: GOrilla is a web-based application that identifies enriched GO terms in ranked lists of genes, without requiring the user to provide explicit target and background sets. This is particularly useful in many typical cases where genomic data may be naturally represented as a ranked list of genes (e.g. by level of expression or of differential expression). GOrilla employs a flexible threshold statistical approach to discover GO terms that are significantly enriched at the top of a ranked gene list. Building on a complete theoretical characterization of the underlying distribution, called mHG, GOrilla computes an exact p-value for the observed enrichment, taking threshold multiple testing into account without the need for simulations. This enables rigorous statistical analysis of thousand of genes and thousands of GO terms in order of seconds. The output of the enrichment analysis is visualized as a hierarchical structure, providing a clear view of the relations between enriched GO terms. CONCLUSION: GOrilla is an efficient GO analysis tool with unique features that make a useful addition to the existing repertoire of GO enrichment tools. GOrilla's unique features and advantages over other threshold free enrichment tools include rigorous statistics, fast running time and an effective graphical representation. GOrilla is publicly available at: http://cbl-gorilla.cs.technion.ac.il},

abstract = {This study examined whether the anticholinergic potency of the clinically superior antipsychotic drug clozapine contributes to clozapine's anatomically-selective functional inhibition of the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system, using an electrical brain-stimulation reward (BSR) paradigm in rats that has been previously shown to be highly sensitive to clozapine's mesolimbic functional selectivity. Rats were chronically administered saline, clozapine, haloperidol, or haloperidol plus the anticholinergic compound trihexyphenidyl, and threshold sensitivity of the mesolimbic and nigrostriatal DA systems was assessed using the BSR paradigm, to infer degree of functional DA blockade produced by the chronic drug regimens. Chronic saline produced no change in either DA system. Congruent with previous findings, chronic clozapine powerfully inhibited the mesolimbic DA system but spared the nigrostriatal DA system. Also congruent with previous findings, chronic haloperidol powerfully inhibited both DA systems. Compared to chronic haloperidol alone, chronic haloperidol plus chronic trihexyphenidyl exerted diminished anti-DA action in both the mesolimbic and nigrostriatal DA systems. These results suggest that clozapine's anticholinergic potency is not an adequate explanation for its functional mesolimbic selectivity.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWASs), also called common variant association studies (CVASs), have uncovered thousands of genetic variants associated with hundreds of diseases. However, the variants that reach statistical significance typically explain only a small fraction of the heritability. One explanation for the “missing heritability” is that there are many additional disease-associated common variants whose effects are too small to detect with current sample sizes. It therefore is useful to have methods to quantify the heritability due to common variation, without having to identify all causal variants. Recent studies applied restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation to case–control studies for diseases. Here, we show that REML considerably underestimates the fraction of heritability due to common variation in this setting. The degree of underestimation increases with the rarity of disease, the heritability of the disease, and the size of the sample. Instead, we develop a general framework for heritability estimation, called phenotype correlation–genotype correlation (PCGC) regression, which generalizes the well-known Haseman–Elston regression method. We show that PCGC regression yields unbiased estimates. Applying PCGC regression to six diseases, we estimate the proportion of the phenotypic variance due to common variants to range from 25{\%} to 56{\%} and the proportion of heritability due to common variants from 41{\%} to 68{\%} (mean 60{\%}). These results suggest that common variants may explain at least half the heritability for many diseases. PCGC regression also is readily applicable to other settings, including analyzing extreme-phenotype studies and adjusting for covariates such as sex, age, and population structure.},

Understanding the regulation of these processes requires sensitive and specific detection of differential isoform abundance in comparisons between conditions, cell types, or tissues. We present DEXSeq, a statistical method to test for differential exon usage in RNA-seq data. DEXSeq uses generalized linear models and offers reliable control of false discoveries by taking biological variation into account. DEXSeq detects with high sensitivity genes, and in many cases exons, that are subject to differential exon usage. We demonstrate the versatility of DEXSeq by applying it to several data sets. The method facilitates the study of regulation and function of alternative exon usage on a genome-wide scale. An implementation of DEXSeq is available as an R/Bioconductor package.},

The atypical drugs differ from the typicals in their mechanism of action, but not all share the same mechanism. Many, but not all, atypicals have been found to improve cognitive function, which could be their most important advantage with regard to efficacy. Clozapine, the prototype of these agents, has been found to improve delusions and hallucinations in patients who fail to respond to other antipsychotic drugs, and to reduce the risk of suicide. These agents have been found to increase cortical dopamine and acetylcholine release, as well as have a variety of effects on the glutamatergic system not shared by the typical agents. Effects on neuronal survival and plasticity, together with decreased neurotoxicity, might also contribute to their clinical advantage over typical neuroleptic drugs.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics (SGAs) are more expensive than first-generation (typical) antipsychotics (FGAs) but are perceived to be more effective, with fewer adverse effects, and preferable to patients. Most evidence comes from short-term efficacy trials of symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that in people with schizophrenia requiring a change in treatment, SGAs other than clozapine are associated with improved quality of life across 1 year compared with FGAs. DESIGN: A noncommercially funded, pragmatic, multisite, randomized controlled trial of antipsychotic drug classes, with blind assessments at 12, 26, and 56 weeks using intention-to-treat analysis. SETTING: Fourteen community psychiatric services in the English National Health Service. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred twenty-seven people aged 18 to 65 years with DSM-IV schizophrenia and related disorders assessed for medication review because of inadequate response or adverse effects. INTERVENTIONS: Randomized prescription of either FGAs or SGAs (other than clozapine), with the choice of individual drug made by the managing psychiatrist. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality of Life Scale scores, symptoms, adverse effects, participant satisfaction, and costs of care. RESULTS: The primary hypothesis of significant improvement in Quality of Life Scale scores during the year after commencement of SGAs vs FGAs was excluded. Participants in the FGA arm showed a trend toward greater improvements in Quality of Life Scale and symptom scores. Participants reported no clear preference for either drug group; costs were similar. CONCLUSIONS: In people with schizophrenia whose medication is changed for clinical reasons, there is no disadvantage across 1 year in terms of quality of life, symptoms, or associated costs of care in using FGAs rather than nonclozapine SGAs. Neither inadequate power nor patterns of drug discontinuation accounted for the result.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: During the past two decades several genes have been identified that control morphogenesis and differentiation of the enteric neuron system (ENS). These genes, when mutated or deleted, interfere with ENS development. RET gene is the major gene causing Hirschsprung's disease (HD). Mutations in RET gene are responsible for 50{\%} of familial HD cases and 15-20{\%} of sporadic cases. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the incidence of RET gene mutations in patients with HD and to correlate RET mutations with the extent of aganglionosis. METHODS: A systematic literature-based search for relevant cohorts was performed using the terms "Hirschsprung's disease AND RET Proto-oncogene", "Hirschsprung's disease AND genetic polymorphism" and "RET Gene". The relevant cohorts of HD were systematically searched for reported mutations in the RET gene (RET+). Data on mutation site, phenotype, and familial or sporadic cases were extracted. Combined odds ratio (OR) with 95{\%} CI was calculated to estimate the strength of the different associations. RESULTS: In total, 23 studies concerning RET with 1270 individuals affected with HD were included in this study. 228 (18{\%}) of these HDs were RET+. Of these 228, 96 (42{\%}) presented as rectosigmoid, 81 (36{\%}) long segment, 18 (8{\%}) as TCA, 16 (7{\%}) as total intestinal aganglionosis and 17 (7{\%}) individuals were RET+ but no extent of aganglionosis was not reported. In the rectosigmoid group, no significant association between phenotype and RET mutation could be shown (P = 0.006), whereas a clear association could be shown between long-segment disease, total colonic- and total intestinal aganglionosis and RET mutations (P = 0.0002). Mutations most often occurred in Exon 13 (24) and showed significant association with rectosigmoid disease (P = 0.004). No significance could be shown between RET+ and sporadic cases (P = 0.53), albeit a trend towards RET+ and Familial cases could be observed (P = 0.38). CONCLUSIONS: The association with the RET gene and HD is well recognized. This study showed a clear association between RET+ mutations and the long-segment, total colonic- and total intestinal aganglionosis. Exon 13 appears to be a mutational "hot spot" in rectosigmoid disease.},

abstract = {Brain development is a remarkable process. Progenitor cells are born, differentiate, and migrate to their final locations. Axons and dendrites branch and form important synaptic connections that set the stage for encoding information potentially for the rest of life. In the mammalian brain, synapses and receptors within most regions are overproduced and eliminated by as much as 50{\%} during two phases of life: immediately before birth and during the transitions from childhood, adolescence, to adulthood. This process results in different critical and sensitive periods of brain development. Since Hebb (1949) first postulated that the strengthening of synaptic elements occurs through functional validation, researchers have applied this approach to understanding the sculpting of the immature brain. In this manner, the brain becomes wired to match the needs of the environment. Extensions of this hypothesis posit that exposure to both positive and negative elements before adolescence can imprint on the final adult topography in a manner that differs from exposure to the same elements after adolescence. This review endeavors to provide an overview of key components of mammalian brain development while simultaneously providing a framework for how perturbations during these changes uniquely impinge on the final outcome.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent that is more effective than standard neuroleptic drugs in the treatment of patients with refractory schizophrenia. Unlike classic neuroleptic agents, clozapine is not associated with the development of acute extrapyramidal symptoms or tardive dyskinesia. The main factor limiting its use is the risk of potentially fatal agranulocytosis, estimated to occur in 1 to 2 percent of treated patients. After clozapine was approved by the Food and Drug Administration, it became available for marketing in the United States in February 1990 only as part of a special surveillance system (the Clozaril Patient Management System, or CPMS), in which a weekly white-cell count was required for the patient to receive a supply of the drug. METHODS: We evaluated the CPMS data for February 1990 through April 1991 by survival analysis to determine the incidence of agranulocytosis and the effects of potential risk factors such as age and sex. Data were available for 11,555 patients who received clozapine during the period after marketing began. RESULTS: Agranulocytosis developed in 73 patients, resulting in death from infectious complications in 2 patients. Episodes of agranulocytosis occurred in 61 patients within three months after they began treatment. The cumulative incidence of this side effect was 0.80 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.61 to 0.99) at 1 year and 0.91 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.62 to 1.20) at 1 1/2 years. The risk of agranulocytosis increased with age and was higher among women. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of agranulocytosis is a substantial hazard of the administration of clozapine, but this hazard can be reduced by monitoring the white-cell count. The increasing risk of agranulocytosis with age and the reduced incidence after the first six months of treatment provide additional guidelines for the prescription and monitoring of clozapine treatment in the future.},

In the MDD discovery phase, we analyzed more than 1.2 million autosomal and X chromosome single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 18 759 independent and unrelated subjects of recent European ancestry (9240 MDD cases and 9519 controls). In the MDD replication phase, we evaluated 554 SNPs in independent samples (6783 MDD cases and 50 695 controls). We also conducted a cross-disorder meta-analysis using 819 autosomal SNPs with P<0.0001 for either MDD or the Psychiatric GWAS Consortium bipolar disorder (BIP) mega-analysis (9238 MDD cases/8039 controls and 6998 BIP cases/7775 controls). No SNPs achieved genome-wide significance in the MDD discovery phase, the MDD replication phase or in pre-planned secondary analyses (by sex, recurrent MDD, recurrent early-onset MDD, age of onset, pre-pubertal onset MDD or typical-like MDD from a latent class analyses of the MDD criteria). In the MDD-bipolar cross-disorder analysis, 15 SNPs exceeded genome-wide significance (P<5 x 10(-8)), and all were in a 248 kb interval of high LD on 3p21.1 (chr3:52 425 083-53 822 102, minimum P=5.9 x 10(-9) at rs2535629). Although this is the largest genome-wide analysis of MDD yet conducted, its high prevalence means that the sample is still underpowered to detect genetic effects typical for complex traits. Therefore, we were unable to identify robust and replicable findings. We discuss what this means for genetic research for MDD. The 3p21.1 MDD-BIP finding should be interpreted with caution as the most significant SNP did not replicate in MDD samples, and genotyping in independent samples will be needed to resolve its status.},

We propose to call the phenomenon 'The Wilson Effect' and we document the effect diagrammatically with key twin and adoption studies, including twins reared apart, that have been carried out at various ages and in a large number of different settings. The results show that the heritability of IQ reaches an asymptote at about 0.80 at 18-20 years of age and continuing at that level well into adulthood. In the aggregate, the studies also confirm that shared environmental influence decreases across age, approximating about 0.10 at 18-20 years of age and continuing at that level into adulthood. These conclusions apply to the Westernized industrial democracies in which most of the studies have been carried out.},

abstract = {The major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are thought to be multifactorial diseases related to both genetic and environmental factors. However, the genes responsible and the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of SZ and MDD remain unclear. We previously reported that abnormalities of disrupted-in-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) and DISC1 binding zinc finger (DBZ) might cause major psychiatric disorders such as SZ. Interestingly, both DISC and DBZ have been further detected in oligodendrocytes and implicated in regulating oligodendrocyte differentiation. DISC1 negatively regulates the differentiation of oligodendrocytes, whereas DBZ plays a positive regulatory role in oligodendrocyte differentiation. We have reported that repeated stressful events, one of the major risk factors of MDD, can induce sustained upregulation of plasma corticosterone levels and serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1 (Sgk1) mRNA expression in oligodendrocytes. Repeated stressful events can also activate the SGK1 cascade and cause excess arborization of oligodendrocyte processes, which is thought to be related to depressive-like symptoms. In this review, we discuss the expression of DISC1, DBZ, and SGK1 in oligodendrocytes, their roles in the regulation of oligodendrocyte function, possible interactions of DISC1 and DBZ in relation to SZ, and the activation of the SGK1 signaling cascade in relation to MDD.},

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) is a widely deployed transcriptome profiling and annotation technique, but questions about the performance of different protocols and platforms remain. We used a newly developed pool of 96 synthetic RNAs with various lengths, and GC content covering a 2(20) concentration range as spike-in controls to measure sensitivity, accuracy, and biases in RNA-seq experiments as well as to derive standard curves for quantifying the abundance of transcripts. We observed linearity between read density and RNA input over the entire detection range and excellent agreement between replicates, but we observed significantly larger imprecision than expected under pure Poisson sampling errors. We use the control RNAs to directly measure reproducible protocol-dependent biases due to GC content and transcript length as well as stereotypic heterogeneity in coverage across transcripts correlated with position relative to RNA termini and priming sequence bias. These effects lead to biased quantification for short transcripts and individual exons, which is a serious problem for measurements of isoform abundances, but that can partially be corrected using appropriate models of bias. By using the control RNAs, we derive limits for the discovery and detection of rare transcripts in RNA-seq experiments. By using data collected as part of the model organism and human Encyclopedia of DNA Elements projects (ENCODE and modENCODE), we demonstrate that external RNA controls are a useful resource for evaluating sensitivity and accuracy of RNA-seq experiments for transcriptome discovery and quantification. These quality metrics facilitate comparable analysis across different samples, protocols, and platforms. },

abstract = {Beside its role in motor coordination, the cerebellum is involved in cognitive function such as attention, working memory, verbal learning, and sensory discrimination. In schizophrenia, a disturbed prefronto-thalamo-cerebellar circuit has been proposed to play a role in the pathophysiology. In addition, a deficit in the glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has been hypothesized. The risk gene neuregulin 1 may play a major role in this process. We demonstrated a higher expression of the NMDA receptor subunit 2D in the right cerebellar regions of schizophrenia patients, which may be a secondary upregulation due to a dysfunctional receptor. In contrast, the neuregulin 1 risk variant containing at least one C-allele was associated with decreased expression of NMDA receptor subunit 2C, leading to a dysfunction of the NMDA receptor, which in turn may lead to a dysfunction of the gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) system. Accordingly, from post-mortem studies, there is accumulating evidence that GABAergic signaling is decreased in the cerebellum of schizophrenia patients. As patients in these studies are treated with antipsychotics long term, we evaluated the effect of long-term haloperidol and clozapine treatment in an animal model. We showed that clozapine may be superior to haloperidol in restoring a deficit in NMDA receptor subunit 2C expression in the cerebellum. We discuss the molecular findings in the light of the role of the cerebellum in attention and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. },

Data were generated using automated high-throughput procedures for in situ hybridization and data acquisition, and are publicly accessible online. Newly developed image-based informatics tools allow global genome-scale structural analysis and cross-correlation, as well as identification of regionally enriched genes. Unbiased fine-resolution analysis has identified highly specific cellular markers as well as extensive evidence of cellular heterogeneity not evident in classical neuroanatomical atlases. This highly standardized atlas provides an open, primary data resource for a wide variety of further studies concerning brain organization and function.},

abstract = {Environmental insults taking place in early brain development may have long-lasting consequences for adult brain functioning. There is a large body of epidemiological data linking maternal infections during pregnancy to a higher incidence of psychiatric disorders with a presumed neurodevelopmental origin in the offspring, including schizophrenia and autism. Although specific gestational windows may be associated with a differing vulnerability to infection-mediated disturbances in normal brain development, it still remains debatable whether and/or why certain gestation periods may confer maximal risk for neurodevelopmental disturbances following the prenatal exposure to infectious events. In this review, the authors integrate both epidemiological and experimental findings supporting the hypothesis that infection-associated immunological events in early fetal life may have a stronger neurodevelopmental impact compared to late pregnancy infections. This is because infections in early gestation may not only interfere with fundamental neurodevelopmental events such as cell proliferation and differentiation, but it may also predispose the developing nervous system to additional failures in subsequent cell migration, target selection, and synapse maturation, eventually leading to multiple brain and behavioral abnormalities in the adult offspring. The temporal dependency of the epidemiological link between maternal infections during pregnancy and a higher risk for brain disorders in the offspring may thus be explained by specific spatiotemporal events in the course of fetal brain development.},

Experimental data have been generated on a huge number of organisms, tissue types, treatment conditions and disease states. The Gene Expression Omnibus (Barrett et al., 2005), developed by the National Center for Bioinformatics (NCBI) at the National Institutes of Health is a repository of nearly 140,000 gene expression experiments. The BioConductor project (Gentleman et al., 2004) is an open-source and open-development software project built in the R statistical programming environment (R Development core Team, 2005) for the analysis and comprehension of genomic data. The tools contained in the BioConductor project represent many state-of-the-art methods for the analysis of microarray and genomics data. We have developed a software tool that allows access to the wealth of information within GEO directly from BioConductor, eliminating many the formatting and parsing problems that have made such analyses labor-intensive in the past. The software, called GEOquery, effectively establishes a bridge between GEO and BioConductor. Easy access to GEO data from BioConductor will likely lead to new analyses of GEO data using novel and rigorous statistical and bioinformatic tools. Facilitating analyses and meta-analyses of microarray data will increase the efficiency with which biologically important conclusions can be drawn from published genomic data.

abstract = {Emerging evidence points to the involvement of the brain extracellular matrix (ECM) in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (SZ). Abnormalities affecting several ECM components, including Reelin and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), have been described in subjects with this disease. Solid evidence supports the involvement of Reelin, an ECM glycoprotein involved in corticogenesis, synaptic functions and glutamate NMDA receptor regulation, expressed prevalently in distinct populations of GABAergic neurons, which secrete it into the ECM. Marked changes of Reelin expression in SZ have typically been reported in association with GABA-related abnormalities in subjects with SZ and bipolar disorder. Recent findings from our group point to substantial abnormalities affecting CSPGs, a main ECM component, in the amygdala and entorhinal cortex of subjects with schizophrenia, but not bipolar disorder. Striking increases of glial cells expressing CSPGs were accompanied by reductions of perineuronal nets, CSPG- and Reelin-enriched ECM aggregates enveloping distinct neuronal populations. CSPGs developmental and adult functions, including neuronal migration, axon guidance, synaptic and neurotransmission regulation are highly relevant to the pathophysiology of SZ. Together with reports of anomalies affecting several other ECM components, these findings point to the ECM as a key component of the pathology of SZ. We propose that ECM abnormalities may contribute to several aspects of the pathophysiology of this disease, including disrupted connectivity and neuronal migration, synaptic anomalies and altered GABAergic, glutamatergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission.},

The present study has been performed to elucidate the expression of SGK1 in cerebellar Purkinje cells and to explore whether it influences the colocalized glutamate transporter EAAT4. Intense SGK1 staining was observed in Purkinje cells following 48h of water deprivation. The kinase activates glutamate induced current (I(GLU)) in Xenopus oocytes heterologously expressing EAAT4, an effect mimicked by its isoforms SGK2, 3 and PKB. I(GLU) was decreased by the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2, an effect partially but not completely reversed by additional coexpression of the SGK kinase isoforms or PKB. According to immunohistochemistry EAAT4 protein abundance in the cell membrane was enhanced by SGK1 and decreased by Nedd4-2. In conclusion, SGK1 expression is upregulated by ischemia, excitation, and dehydration in cerebellar Purkinje cells. The upregulation of SGK1 may serve to stimulate EAAT4 and thus to reduce neuroexcitotoxicity.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a highly heritable neuropsychiatric disorder of complex genetic etiology. Previous genome-wide surveys have revealed a greater burden of large, rare copy number variations (CNVs) in SCZ cases and identified multiple rare recurrent CNVs that increase risk of SCZ although with incomplete penetrance and pleiotropic effects. Identification of additional recurrent CNVs and biological pathways enriched for SCZ CNVs requires greater sample sizes. We conducted a genome-wide survey for CNVs associated with SCZ using a Swedish national sample (4719 cases and 5917 controls). High-confidence CNV calls were generated using genotyping array intensity data, and their effect on risk of SCZ was measured. Our data confirm increased burden of large, rare CNVs in SCZ cases as well as significant associations for recurrent 16p11.2 duplications, 22q11.2 deletions and 3q29 deletions. We report a novel association for 17q12 duplications (odds ratio=4.16, P=0.018), previously associated with autism and mental retardation but not SCZ. Intriguingly, gene set association analyses implicate biological pathways previously associated with SCZ through common variation and exome sequencing (calcium channel signaling and binding partners of the fragile X mental retardation protein). We found significantly increased burden of the largest CNVs (>500[thinsp]kb) in genes present in the postsynaptic density, in genomic regions implicated via SCZ genome-wide association studies and in gene products localized to mitochondria and cytoplasm. Our findings suggest that multiple lines of genomic inquiry[mdash]genome-wide screens for CNVs, common variation and exonic variation[mdash]are converging on similar sets of pathways and/or genes.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Antipsychotic drug is the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia, and there are large inter-individual differences in clinical response and side effects. Pharmacogenetics provides a valuable tool to fulfill the promise of personalized medicine by tailoring treatment based on one's genetic markers. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews the recent progress in pharmacogenetic research of antipsychotic drugs since 2010, focusing on two areas: antipsychotic-induced weight gain and clozapine-induced agranulocytosis. The article also provides discussion on the important methodological issues in this area of research. The specific aim of this article is to provide the reader with up-to-date evidence in pharmacogenetic research, and for them to gain familiarity to the issues and challenges facing the field. EXPERT OPINION: Pharmacogenetic studies of antipsychotic drugs are promising despite many challenges. Recent advances as reviewed in this article push the field closer to routine clinical utilization of pharmacogenetic testing. Progress in genomic technology and bioinformatics, larger sample sizes, better phenotype characterization, and careful consideration of study design issues will help to elevate antipsychotic pharmacogenetics to its next level.},

Despite its superior efficacy and potential to reduce substantially the morbidity of schizophrenia and improve the outcomes, of patients, clozapine has not been used on a widespread basis or as a first-line treatment due to its potential for agranulocytosis. With the introduction of risperidone and the imminent prospect of other atypical antipsychotic drugs (olanzapine, sertindole, quetiapine, ziprasidone), clinicians may be able to improve dramatically the methods and manner in which they treat schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders. If we accept the premise that atypical antipsychotic drug provide superior efficacy, reduced side effects, and the prospect of better compliance, their greatest impact may be when used in patients at the beginning of their illness.

abstract = {Central nervous system disorders are the third greatest health problem in developed countries, and schizophrenia represents some of the most disabling ailments in young individuals. There is an abuse and/or misuse of antipsychotics, and recent advances in pharmacogenomics pose new challenges for the clinical management of this complex disorder. Schizophrenia is a multi-factorial/polygenic complex disorder in which hundreds of different genes are potentially involved, leading to the phenotypic expression of the disease in conjunction with epigenetic and environmental phenomena. Consequently, structural and functional genomic changes induce proteomic and metabolomic defects associated with the disease phenotype. Disease-related genomic profiles and genetic variants in genes involved in drug metabolism are responsible for drug efficacy and safety. About 20{\%} of Caucasians are defective in CYP2D6 enzymes, which participate in the metabolism of 25-30{\%} of central nervous system drugs. Approximately 40{\%} of antipsychotics are substrates of CYP2D6 enzymes, 23{\%} are substrates of CYP3A4, and 18{\%} are substrates of CYP1A2. In order to achieve a mature discipline of pharmacogenomics of schizophrenia it would be effective to accelerate: (i) the education of physicians and the public in the use of genomic screening in daily clinical practice; (ii) the standardization of genetic testing for major categories of drugs; (iii) the validation of pharmacogenomic procedures according to drug category and pathology; (iv) the regulation of ethical, social, and economic issues; and (v) the incorporation of pharmacogenomic procedures of drugs in development and drugs on the market in order to optimize therapeutics.},

These models provide indispensable experimental tools to test the hypothesis of causality in human epidemiological associations, and to explore the critical neuroimmunological and developmental factors involved in shaping the vulnerability to infection-induced neurodevelopmental disturbances in humans. Here, we summarize the findings derived from numerous in-vivo models of prenatal infection and/or immune activation in rats and mice, including models of exposure to influenza virus, bacterial endotoxin, viral-like acute phase responses and specific pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, we discuss the methodological aspects of these models in relation to their practical implementation and their translatability to the human condition. We highlight that these models can successfully examine the influence of the precise timing of maternal immune activation, the role of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and the contribution of gene–environment interactions in the association between prenatal immune challenge and postnatal brain dysfunctions. Finally, we discuss that in-vivo models of prenatal immune activation offer a unique opportunity to establish and evaluate early preventive interventions aiming to reduce the risk of long-lasting brain dysfunctions following prenatal exposure to infection.},

abstract = {Oxford Nanopore's third-generation single-molecule sequencing platform promises to decrease costs for reagents and instrumentation. After a 2-year hiatus following the initial announcement, the first devices have been released as part of an early access program. We explore the performance of this platform by resequencing the lambda phage genome, and amplicons from a snake venom gland transcriptome. Although the handheld MinION sequencer can generate more than 150 megabases of raw data in one run, at most a quarter of the resulting reads map to the reference, with less than average 10{\%} identity. Much of the sequence consists of insertion/deletion errors, or is seemingly without similarity to the template. Using the lambda phage data as an example, although the reads are long, averaging 5 kb, at best 890 +/- 1932 bases per mapped read could be matched to the reference without soft clipping. In the course of a 36 h run on the MinION, it was possible to resequence the 48 kb lambda phage reference at 16x coverage. Currently, substantially larger projects would not be feasible using the MinION. Without increases in accuracy, which would be required for applications such as genome scaffolding and phasing, the current utility of the MinION appears limited. Library preparation requires access to a molecular laboratory, and is of similar complexity and cost to that of other next-generation sequencing platforms. The MinION is an exciting step in a new direction for single-molecule sequencing, though it will require dramatic decreases in error rates before it lives up to its promise.},

As glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS), the implications of glutamate excitotoxicity are many and far-reaching. Acute CNS insults such as ischaemia and traumatic brain injury have traditionally been the focus of excitotoxicity research. However, glutamate excitotoxicity has also been linked to chronic neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and others. Despite the continued research into the mechanisms of excitotoxicity, there are currently no pharmacological interventions capable of providing significant neuroprotection in the clinical setting of brain ischaemia or injury. This review addresses the current state of excitotoxic research, focusing on the structure and physiology of glutamate receptors; molecular mechanisms underlying excitotoxic cell death pathways and their interactions with each other; the evidence for glutamate excitotoxicity in acute neurologic diseases; laboratory and clinical attempts at modulating excitotoxicity; and emerging targets for excitotoxicity research.},

abstract = {Although an immune dysfunction and the involvement of infectious agents in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia are discussed since decades, the field never came into the mainstream of research. In schizophrenia a blunted type-1 immune response seems to be associated with a dysbalance in the activation of the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and in the tryptophan - kynurenine metabolism resulting in increased production of kynurenic acid in schizophrenia. This is associated with an imbalance in the glutamatergic neurotransmission, leading to an NMDA antagonism in schizophrenia. The immunological effects of antipsychotics rebalance partly the immune imbalance and the overweight of the production of the kynurenic acid. This immunological imbalance results in an inflammatory state combined with increased prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production and increased cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. COX-2 inhibitors have been tested in clinical trials, pointing to favourable effects in schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Abstract Although a number of first- and second-generation antipsychotics are available, achieving optimal therapeutic response for patients with schizophrenia can be challenging. The presence of polymorphic alleles for cytochrome P (CYP) 450 may result in lack of expression, altered levels of expression, or altered function of CYP450 enzymes. CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4/5 are major enzymes in the metabolism of antipsychotics and polymorphisms of alleles for these proteins are associated with altered plasma levels. Consequently, standard dosing may result in drug plasma concentrations that are subtherapeutic or toxic in some patients. Patient CYP450 genotype testing can predict altered pharmacokinetics, and is currently available and relatively inexpensive. Evidence-based guidelines provide dose recommendations for some antipsychotics. To date few studies have demonstrated a significant association with genotype-guided antipsychotic use and clinical efficacy. However, many studies have been small, retrospective or cohort designs, and many have not been adequately powered. Numerous studies have shown a significant association between genotype and adverse effects, such as CYP2D6 polymorphisms and tardive dyskinesia. This review summarizes evidence for the role of CYP450 genetic variants in the response to antipsychotic medications and the clinical implications of pharmacogenetics in the management of patients with schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Hirschsprung disease (HSCR, aganglionic megacolon) is a complex genetic disorder  of the enteric nervous system (ENS) characterized by the absence of enteric neurons along a variable length of the intestine. While rare variants (RVs) in the coding sequence (CDS) of several genes involved in ENS development lead to disease, the association of common variants (CVs) with HSCR has only been reported for RET (the major HSCR gene) and NRG1. Importantly, RVs in the CDS of these two genes are also associated with the disorder. To assess independent and joint effects between the different types of RET and NRG1 variants identified in HSCR patients, we used 254 Chinese sporadic HSCR patients and 143 ethnically matched controls for whom the RET and/or NRG1 variants genotypes (rare and common) were available. Four genetic risk factors were defined and interaction effects were modeled using conditional logistic regression analyses and pair-wise Kendall correlations. Our analysis revealed a joint effect of RET CVs with RET RVs, NRG1 CVs or NRG1 RVs. To assess whether the genetic interaction translated into functional interaction, mouse neural crest cells (NCCs; enteric neuron precursors) isolated from embryonic guts were treated with NRG1 (ErbB2 ligand) or/and GDNF (Ret ligand) and monitored during the subsequent neural differentiation process. Nrg1 inhibited the Gdnf-induced neuronal differentiation and Gdnf negatively regulated Nrg1-signaling by down-regulating the expression of its receptor, ErbB2. This preliminary data suggest that the balance neurogenesis/gliogenesis is critical for ENS development.},

@article{Miller2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genomic and other high dimensional analyses often require one to summarize multiple related variables by a single representative. This task is also variously referred to as collapsing, combining, reducing, or aggregating variables. Examples include summarizing several probe measurements corresponding to a single gene, representing the expression profiles of a co-expression module by a single expression profile, and aggregating cell-type marker information to de-convolute expression data. Several standard statistical summary techniques can be used, but network methods also provide useful alternative methods to find representatives. Currently few collapsing functions are developed and widely applied. RESULTS: We introduce the R function collapseRows that implements several collapsing methods and evaluate its performance in three applications. First, we study a crucial step of the meta-analysis of microarray data: the merging of independent gene expression data sets, which may have been measured on different platforms. Toward this end, we collapse multiple microarray probes for a single gene and then merge the data by gene identifier. We find that choosing the probe with the highest average expression leads to best between-study consistency. Second, we study methods for summarizing the gene expression profiles of a co-expression module. Several gene co-expression network analysis applications show that the optimal collapsing strategy depends on the analysis goal. Third, we study aggregating the information of cell type marker genes when the aim is to predict the abundance of cell types in a tissue sample based on gene expression data ("expression deconvolution"). We apply different collapsing methods to predict cell type abundances in peripheral human blood and in mixtures of blood cell lines. Interestingly, the most accurate prediction method involves choosing the most highly connected "hub" marker gene. Finally, to facilitate biological interpretation of collapsed gene lists, we introduce the function userListEnrichment, which assesses the enrichment of gene lists for known brain and blood cell type markers, and for other published biological pathways. CONCLUSIONS: The R function collapseRows implements several standard and network-based collapsing methods. In various genomic applications we provide evidence that both types of methods are robust and biologically relevant tools.},

abstract = {This brief review traces the serotonin (5-HT) hypothesis of the action of hallucinogenic drugs from the early 1950s to the present day. There is now converging evidence from biochemical, electrophysiological, and behavioral studies that the two major classes of psychedelic hallucinogens, the indoleamines (e.g., LSD) and the phenethylamines (e.g., mescaline), have a common site of action as partial agonists at 5-HT2A and other 5-HT2 receptors in the central nervous system. The noradrenergic locus coeruleus and the cerebral cortex are among the regions where hallucinogens have prominent effects through their actions upon a 5-HT2A receptors. Recently, we have observed a novel effect of hallucinogens--a 5-HT2A receptor-mediated enhancement of nonsynchronous, late components of glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic potentials at apical dendrites of layer V cortical pyramidal cells. We propose that an effect of hallucinogens upon glutamatergic transmission in the cerebral cortex may be responsible for the higher-level cognitive, perceptual, and affective distortions produced by these drugs.},

abstract = {Hypofunction of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid-type glutamate receptors (NMDAR) induced by the systemic administration of NMDAR antagonists is well known to cause schizophrenia-like symptoms in otherwise healthy subjects. However, the brain areas or cell types responsible for the emergence of these symptoms following NMDAR hypofunction remain largely unknown. One possibility, the so-called “GABAergic origin hypothesis,” is that NMDAR hypofunction at GABAergic interneurons, in particular, is sufficient for schizophrenia-like effects. In one attempt to address this issue, transgenic mice were generated in which NMDARs were selectively deleted from cortical and hippocampal GABAergic interneurons, a majority of which were parvalbumin (PV)-positive. This manipulation triggered a constellation of phenotypes—from molecular and physiological to behavioral—resembling characteristics of human schizophrenia. Based on these results, and in conjunction with previous literature, we argue that during development, NMDAR hypofunction at cortical, PV-positive, fast-spiking interneurons produces schizophrenia-like effects. This review summarizes the data demonstrating that in schizophrenia, GABAergic (particularly PV-positive) interneurons are disrupted. PV-positive interneurons, many of which display a fast-spiking firing pattern, are critical not only for tight temporal control of cortical inhibition but also for the generation of synchronous membrane-potential gamma-band oscillations. We therefore suggest that in schizophrenia the specific ability of fast-spiking interneurons to control and synchronize disparate cortical circuits is disrupted and that this disruption may underlie many of the schizophrenia symptoms. We further argue that the high vulnerability of corticolimbic fast-spiking interneurons to genetic predispositions and to early environmental insults—including excitotoxicity and oxidative stress—might help to explain their significant contribution to the development of schizophrenia. },

We report on the development and initial standardization of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) for typological and dimensional assessment. Based on two established psychiatric rating systems, the 30-item PANSS was conceived as an operationalized, drug-sensitive instrument that provides balanced representation of positive and negative symptoms and gauges their relationship to one another and to global psychopathology. It thus constitutes four scales measuring positive and negative syndromes, their differential, and general severity of illness. Study of 101 schizophrenics found the four scales to be normally distributed and supported their reliability and stability. Positive and negative scores were inversely correlated once their common association with general psychopathology was extracted, suggesting that they represent mutually exclusive constructs. Review of five studies involving the PANSS provided evidence of its criterion-related validity with antecedent, genealogical, and concurrent measures, its predictive validity, its drug sensitivity, and its utility for both typological and dimensional assessment. },

abstract = {Understanding individual differences in the susceptibility to metabolic side effects as a response to antipsychotic therapy is essential to optimize the treatment of schizophrenia. Here, we perform genomewide association studies (GWAS) to search for genetic variation affecting the susceptibility to metabolic side effects. The analysis sample consisted of 738 schizophrenia patients, successfully genotyped for 492K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), from the genomic subsample of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trial of Intervention Effectiveness study. Outcomes included 12 indicators of metabolic side effects, quantifying antipsychotic-induced change in weight, blood lipids, glucose and hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure and heart rate. Our criterion for genomewide significance was a pre-specified threshold that ensures, on average, only 10{\%} of the significant findings are false discoveries. A total of 21 SNPs satisfied this criterion. The top finding indicated that a SNP in Meis homeobox 2 (MEIS2) mediated the effects of risperidone on hip circumference (q=0.004). The same SNP was also found to mediate risperidone's effect on waist circumference (q=0.055). Genomewide significant finding were also found for SNPs in PRKAR2B, GPR98, FHOD3, RNF144A, ASTN2, SOX5 and ATF7IP2, as well as in several intergenic markers. PRKAR2B and MEIS2 both have previous research indicating metabolic involvement, and PRKAR2B has previously been shown to mediate antipsychotic response. Although our findings require replication and functional validation, this study shows the potential of GWAS to discover genes and pathways that potentially mediate adverse effects of antipsychotic medication.},

abstract = {Mouse embryonic brain development involves sequential differentiation of multipotent progenitors into neurons and glia cells. Using microarrays and large 2-DE, we investigated the mouse brain transcriptome and proteome of embryonic days 9.5, 11.5, and 13.5. During this developmental period, neural progenitor cells shift from proliferation to neuronal differentiation. As expected, we detected numerous expression changes between all time points investigated, but interestingly, the rate of alteration remained in a similar range within 2 days of development. Furthermore, up- and down-regulation of gene products was balanced at each time point which was also seen at embryonic days 16-18. We hypothesize that during embryonic development, the rate of gene expression alteration is rather constant due to limited cellular resources such as energy, space, and free water. A similar complexity in terms of expressed genes and proteins suggests that changes in relative concentrations rather than an increase in the number of gene products dominate cellular differentiation. In general, expression of metabolism and cell cycle related gene products was down-regulated when precursor cells switched from proliferation to neuronal differentiation (days 9.5-11.5), whereas neuron specific gene products were up-regulated. A detailed functional analysis revealed their implication in differentiation related processes such as rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton as well as Notch- and Wnt-signaling pathways.},

abstract = {It is no longer tenable to attribute all the antipsychotic action of antipsychotic drugs to dopamine (DA) D2 receptor blockade and subsequent development of depolarization inactivation of the mesolimbic or mesocortical DA neurons. The chief evidence for this position is that clozapine (CLOZ) does not differ from typical antipsychotic drugs in these regards but is more effective than typical neuroleptic drugs. The mechanism of action of atypical antipsychotic drugs related to CLOZ may involve reduction of dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic system by a variety of mechanisms, including D1 and D2 receptor blockade. Relatively higher affinity for the serotonin (5HT)2 receptor than for the D2 receptor may also be important to the action of CLOZ-like compounds. Enhanced DA release in the mesocortical system may be relevant to the effectiveness of these agents in treating negative symptoms. Several other classes of new agents alter the dopaminergic system by means of alternative mechanisms. Partial DA agonists may modulate DA neurotransmission more adequately than pure antagonists by producing a mix of direct agonist and antagonistic effects. DA autoreceptor agonists and 5HT3 antagonists appear to act by diminishing the release of DA from some, but not all, DA neurons. Substituted benzamides are “pure” D2 antagonists with some in vivo selectivity for limbic D2 over striatal D2 receptors. Highly selective D1 antagonists have been proposed to produce equivalent antipsychotic activity and fewer extrapyramidal symptoms than D2 antagonists. Antagonists of the recently identified D3 receptors are being sought. Excessive stimulation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of the glutamate receptor, leading to neurotoxicity or diminished activation of this receptor, is the target of novel approaches to treating schizophrenia. Phencyclidine (PCP) antagonists that would activate the NMDA receptor and sigma receptor antagonists are of interest as antipsychotic agents. Therapeutic strategies for treating schizophrenia, schizophrenia-related disorders, and other psychoses will likely be genuinely diverse in the next decade.},

abstract = {We have previously demonstrated that the serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (sgk) gene plays a causal role in facilitating memory performance in rats. Environment enrichment is known to facilitate spatial learning. We therefore examined the effect of enrichment on sgk expression. We also examined the role of sgk in spatial and nonspatial learning and the regulation of sgk expression by activation of different glutamate receptors. Both real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses revealed that enrichment training preferentially increased sgk mRNA and protein levels in the hippocampus. Transfection of sgk mutant DNA to the hippocampal CA1 area markedly impaired spatial learning, fear-conditioning learning and novel object-recognition learning in rats, but enrichment training effectively reversed these learning deficits. Meanwhile, S422A mutant DNA transfection prevented enrichment-induced spatial learning facilitation. In studying glutamate receptor regulation of sgk expression, we found that blockade of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in general, and the NR2B subunit in particular both effectively blocked enrichment-induced spatial learning facilitation, but they did not block enrichment-induced sgk expression. Upon various glutamate agonist infusions, only alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) increased sgk mRNA levels significantly in the hippocampus. Furthermore, blockade of AMPA receptors effectively blocked both enrichment-induced spatial learning facilitation and sgk expression. These results indicate that there is a dissociation between NMDA receptor activation and sgk expression. Enrichment enhanced spatial learning through both NMDA and AMPA receptor activation, whereas enrichment-induced sgk expression is specifically mediated through AMPA receptors. These results suggest that sgk could serve as a novel molecular mechanism, in addition to the NMDA receptor NR2B, underlying enrichment-induced learning facilitation.},

abstract = {High-throughput RNA sequencing is an increasingly accessible method for studying gene structure and activity on a genome-wide scale. A critical step in RNA-seq data analysis is the alignment of partial transcript reads to a reference genome sequence. To assess the performance of current mapping software, we invited developers of RNA-seq aligners to process four large human and mouse RNA-seq data sets. In total, we compared 26 mapping protocols based on 11 programs and pipelines and found major performance differences between methods on numerous benchmarks, including alignment yield, basewise accuracy, mismatch and gap placement, exon junction discovery and suitability of alignments for transcript reconstruction. We observed concordant results on real and simulated RNA-seq data, confirming the relevance of the metrics employed. Future developments in RNA-seq alignment methods would benefit from improved placement of multimapped reads, balanced utilization of existing gene annotation and a reduced false discovery rate for splice junctions.},

abstract = {Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets. },

@article{Lang2010,
abstract = {The present brief review highlights the putative role of the serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible-kinase-1 (SGK1) in the regulation of neuronal function. SGK1 is genomically upregulated by cell shrinkage and by a variety of hormones including mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. The kinase is activated by insulin and growth factors via phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase (PI3-kinase), phosphoinositide-dependent kinase PDK1 and mammalian target of rapamycin mTORC2. SGK1 upregulates ion channels (e.g. SCN5A, ENaC, ASIC1, TRPV5,6, ROMK, Kv1.1–5, KCNEx/KCNQ1–5, GluR6, VSOAC, ClC2, CFTR), carriers (e.g. NHE3, NKCC2, NCC, NaPiIIb, SMIT, GLUT1,4, SGLT1, NaDC, EAAT1–5, SN1, ASCT2, 4F2/LAT, PepT2), and the Na+/K+-ATPase. SGK1 regulates enzymes (e.g. glycogen-synthase-kinase-3, ubiquitin-ligase Nedd4-2, phosphomannose-mutase-2), and transcription factors (e.g. forkhead transcription factor Foxo3a, $\beta$-catenin, nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF$\kappa$B)). SGK1 participates in the regulation of transport, hormone release, neuroexcitability, inflammation, coagulation, cell proliferation and apoptosis. SGK1 contributes to regulation of renal Na+ retention, renal K+ elimination, salt appetite, gastric acid secretion, intestinal Na+/H+ exchange and nutrient transport, insulin-dependent salt sensitivity of blood pressure, salt sensitivity of peripheral glucose uptake, cardiac repolarization and memory consolidation. Presumably, SGK1 contributes to the regulation of diverse cerebral functions (e.g. memory consolidation, fear retention) and the pathophysiology of several cerebral diseases (e.g. Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, depression, Alzheimer's disease). Despite multiple SGK1 functions, the phenotype of the SGK1 knockout mouse is mild and becomes only apparent under challenging conditions.},

abstract = {The serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase-1 (SGK1) is ubiquitously expressed and under genomic control by cell stress (including cell shrinkage) and hormones (including gluco- and mineralocorticoids). Similar to its isoforms SGK2 and SGK3, SGK1 is activated by insulin and growth factors via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase PDK1. SGKs activate ion channels (e.g., ENaC, TRPV5, ROMK, Kv1.3, KCNE1/KCNQ1, GluR1, GluR6), carriers (e.g., NHE3, GLUT1, SGLT1, EAAT1–5), and the Na+-K+-ATPase.

SGKs participate in the regulation of transport, hormone release, neuroexcitability, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. SGK1 contributes to Na+ retention and K+ elimination of the kidney, mineralocorticoid stimulation of salt appetite, glucocorticoid stimulation of intestinal Na+/H+ exchanger and nutrient transport, insulin-dependent salt sensitivity of blood pressure and salt sensitivity of peripheral glucose uptake, memory consolidation, and cardiac repolarization. A common (∼5{\%} prevalence) SGK1 gene variant is associated with increased blood pressure and body weight. SGK1 may thus contribute to metabolic syndrome. SGK1 may further participate in tumor growth, neurodegeneration, fibrosing disease, and the sequelae of ischemia. SGK3 is required for adequate hair growth and maintenance of intestinal nutrient transport and influences locomotive behavior. In conclusion, the SGKs cover a wide variety of physiological functions and may play an active role in a multitude of pathophysiological conditions. There is little doubt that further targets will be identified that are modulated by the SGK isoforms and that further SGK-dependent in vivo physiological functions and pathophysiological conditions will be defined.},

abstract = {For sixteen years, the American Institute of Nutrition Rodent Diets, AIN-76 and AIN-76A, have been used extensively around the world. Because of numerous nutritional and technical problems encountered with the diet during this period, it was revised. Two new formulations were derived: AIN-93G for growth, pregnancy and lactation, and AIN-93M for adult maintenance. Some major differences in the new formulation of AIN-93G compared with AIN-76A are as follows: 7 g soybean oil/100 g diet was substituted for 5 g corn oil/100 g diet to increase the amount of linolenic acid; cornstarch was substituted for sucrose; the amount of phosphorus was reduced to help eliminate the problem of kidney calcification in female rats; L-cystine was substituted for DL-methionine as the amino acid supplement for casein, known to be deficient in the sulfur amino acids; manganese concentration was lowered to one-fifth the amount in the old diet; the amounts of vitamin E, vitamin K and vitamin B-12 were increased; and molybdenum, silicon, fluoride, nickel, boron, lithium and vanadium were added to the mineral mix. For the AIN-93M maintenance diet, the amount of fat was lowered to 40 g/kg diet from 70 g/kg diet, and the amount of casein to 140 g/kg from 200 g/kg in the AIN-93G diet. Because of a better balance of essential nutrients, the AIN-93 diets may prove to be a better choice than AIN-76A for long-term as well as short-term studies with laboratory rodents.},

It is estimated that comorbid depression occurs in 50{\%} of patients, and perhaps (conservatively) 47{\%} of patients also have a lifetime diagnosis of comorbid substance abuse. This article chronicles these associations, examining whether these comorbidities are “more than chance” and might represent (distinct) phenotypes of schizophrenia. Among the anxiety disorders, the evidence at present is most abundant for an association with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Additional studies in newly diagnosed antipsychotic-naive patients and their first-degree relatives and searches for genetic and environmental risk factors are needed to replicate preliminary findings and further investigate these associations.},

abstract = {Antipsychotic treatment response is highly heterogeneous and unpredictable in terms of both efficacy and side effects. A combination of factors influences treatment outcome, including clinical, demographic, environmental and genetic factors. No comprehensive studies have quantified the relative contributions of these factors to date. Two decades of pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic studies have attempted to identify key gene variants associated with antipsychotic response, with a dual goal of better understanding the mechanisms underlying drug response and guiding prescribing decisions in clinical care. Pharmacogenetic studies have succeeded in identifying several genes that are associated with antipsychotic treatment efficacy or side effects. However, the strength of these associations is modest and they are of limited clinical value. Genome-wide association studies, moving beyond hypothesis-based discovery, have greater potential to identify novel gene associations, although only a few genome-wide association studies have been conducted and they have not revealed clearly significant findings. The first pharmacogenetic tests to guide the selection or dosing of antipsychotic drugs are now commercially available. Their uptake has been limited by the modest level of prediction they offer, compounded by the lack of data supporting their clinical or economic benefits. Advances in genomic analysis techniques, the better characterization of larger subject cohorts and an improved understanding of the role of environmental factors and gene?environment interactions are renewing hope that future research will identify genetic variants with stronger associations with treatment outcome. Tests incorporating such genetic data, with environmental and clinical variables, may offer the potential to personalize medicine and significantly improve the efficacy and tolerability of antipsychotic treatment.},

abstract = {To determine whether dietary fat intake during childhood affects the later risk of developing breast cancer, we fed prepubertal rats between post-natal days 5 and 25 a low (16{\%} energy) or high-fat (39{\%} energy) diet composed mainly of n-6 or n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) originating either from corn oil or menhaden oil, respectively, in the ratios of 16-17:1 (n-6 PUFA diets) or 2-3:1 (n-3 PUFA diets). We also examined whether changes in risk are associated with perturbations in biological processes previously linked to fatty acid intake and breast cancer. Mammary tumorigenesis was induced by treating 50-day-old rats with the carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene. When compared with the reference low-fat n-6 PUFA diet, prepubertal exposure to the low-fat n-3 PUFA diet decreased, whereas a high-fat n-3 PUFA diet increased mammary tumor incidence; the high-fat n-6 PUFA diet had no effect. Both the low and high-fat n-3 PUFA diets induced mammary epithelial differentiation by reducing the number of terminal end buds (TEBs) and increasing the presence of lobulo-alveolar structures. They also increased lipid peroxidation and reduced cyclooxygenase-2 activity. Prepubertal exposure to the low-fat n-3 PUFA diet increased apoptosis, determined using TUNEL assay, and reduced cell proliferation, determined using PCNA staining. In marked contrast, prepubertal exposure to the high-fat n-3 PUFA diet induced cell proliferation and inhibited apoptosis in the TEBs and lobular structures. The latter is consistent with the finding that pAkt, a survival factor that inhibits apoptosis, was elevated in their mammary glands. In summary, although prepubertal exposure to a low-fat n-3 PUFA diet reduced later mammary tumorigenesis in rats, high levels of this fatty acid can have adverse effects on the prepubertal mammary gland and increase subsequent breast cancer risk.},

We show that 45{\%} of variance can be explained by considering all SNPs simultaneously. Thus, most of the heritability is not missing but has not previously been detected because the individual effects are too small to pass stringent significance tests. We provide evidence that the remaining heritability is due to incomplete linkage disequilibrium between causal variants and genotyped SNPs, exacerbated by causal variants having lower minor allele frequency than the SNPs explored to date.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder that affects up to 1{\%} of the population worldwide. Traditional models of schizophrenia have emphasized dopaminergic dysfunction. Over the last 20 years, however, limitations of the dopamine model have become increasingly apparent, necessitating development of alternative models. Glutamatergic models are based upon the observation that the psychotomimetic agents such as phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine induce psychotic symptoms and neurocognitive disturbances similar to those of schizophrenia by blocking neurotransmission at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors. Because glutamate/NMDA receptors are located throughout the brain, glutamatergic models predict widespread cortical dysfunction with particular involvement of NMDA receptors throughout the brain. Further, NMDA receptors are located on brain circuits that regulate dopamine release, suggesting that dopaminergic deficits in schizophrenia may also be secondary to underlying glutamatergic dysfunction. Agents that stimulate NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission, including glycine-site agonists and glycine transport inhibitors, have shown encouraging results in preclinical studies and are currently undergoing clinical development. Encouraging results have been observed as well with agents such as metabotropic 2/3 agonists that decrease resting glutamate levels, reversing potential disruption in firing patterns within prefrontal cortex and possibly other brain regions. Overall, these findings suggest that glutamatergic theories may lead to new conceptualizations and treatment approaches that would not be possible based upon dopaminergic models alone.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To extend the early treatment response literature, this article aims to quantify the extent of heterogeneity and describe the characteristics of treatment response trajectories in schizophrenia. METHODS: Data were extracted from two double-blind, randomized clinical trials that compared amisulpride with risperidone in schizophrenia (n = 538). Available Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) administrations from baseline to Week 8 were used to assess treatment response. Trajectories were calculated with mixed-mode latent class regression modeling from which groups were derived. These groups were compared on clinical and background characteristics. RESULTS: At Week 8, five treatment response trajectories were identified, undifferentiated by medication received, and characterized by varied amelioration levels. Three trajectory groups (n = 414, 76.9{\%}) showed a treatment response trend of amelioration. Of these, two trajectory groups had similar dropout rates (22{\%}, 25{\%}), and two did not significantly differ on BPRS {\%} reduction (approximately 55{\%}, approximately 58{\%}). Trajectory Group 2 (n = 44, 8.2{\%}) was characterized by being oldest, a 21.3 BPRS {\%} reduction, the highest BPRS severity scores, the highest dropout rate (61.4{\%}), and 11.8{\%} meeting Andreasen's remission criterion. Among Trajectory Group 4 (n = 80, 14.9{\%}) symptom reduction was considerable during the first 2 weeks and then gradual. This trajectory group was characterized by being youngest, male, suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, the lowest dropout rate (6.3{\%}), average BPRS baseline scores, an 88.9{\%} BPRS reduction, and 96{\%} meeting Andreasen's remission criterion. CONCLUSIONS: Generally, amelioration characterizes early treatment response, such that approximately 77{\%} are moderate responders, approximately 15{\%} are rapid treatment responders, and approximately 8{\%} are poor responders.},

abstract = {Measurement of linkage disequilibrium involves two sampling processes. First, there is the sampling of gametes in the population to form successive generations, and this generates disequilibrium dependent on the effective population size (Ne) and the mating structure. Second, there is sampling of a finite number (n) of individuals to estimate the population disequilibrium. ——Two-locus descent measures are used to describe the mating system and are transformed to disequilibrium moments at the final sampling. Approximate eigenvectors for the transition matrix of descent measures are used to obtain formulae for the variance of the observed disequilibria as a function of Ne, mating structure, n, and linkage or recombination parameter.—The variance of disequilibrium is the same for monoecious populations with or without random selfing and for dioecious populations with random pairing for each progeny. With monogamy, the variance is slightly higher, the proportional difference being greater for unlinked loci.},

@article{Zheng2006,
abstract = {Population-based case-control studies are a useful method to test for a genetic association between a trait and a marker. However, the analysis of the resulting data can be affected by population stratification or cryptic relatedness, which may inflate the variance of the usual statistics, resulting in a higher-than-nominal rate of false-positive results. One approach to preserving the nominal type I error is to apply genomic control, which adjusts the variance of the Cochran-Armitage trend test by calculating the statistic on data from null loci. This enables one to estimate any additional variance in the null distribution of statistics. When the underlying genetic model (e.g., recessive, additive, or dominant) is known, genomic control can be applied to the corresponding optimal trend tests. In practice, however, the mode of inheritance is unknown. The genotype-based chi (2) test for a general association between the trait and the marker does not depend on the underlying genetic model. Since this general association test has 2 degrees of freedom (df), the existing formulas for estimating the variance factor by use of genomic control are not directly applicable. By expressing the general association test in terms of two Cochran-Armitage trend tests, one can apply genomic control to each of the two trend tests separately, thereby adjusting the chi (2) statistic. The properties of this robust genomic control test with 2 df are examined by simulation. This genomic control-adjusted 2-df test has control of type I error and achieves reasonable power, relative to the optimal tests for each model.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: In model organisms such as yeast, large databases of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions have become an extremely important resource for the study of protein function, evolution, and gene regulatory dynamics. In this paper we demonstrate that by integrating these interactions with widely-available mRNA expression data, it is possible to generate concrete hypotheses for the underlying mechanisms governing the observed changes in gene expression. To perform this integration systematically and at large scale, we introduce an approach for screening a molecular interaction network to identify active subnetworks, i.e., connected regions of the network that show significant changes in expression over particular subsets of conditions. The method we present here combines a rigorous statistical measure for scoring subnetworks with a search algorithm for identifying subnetworks with high score. RESULTS: We evaluated our procedure on a small network of 332 genes and 362 interactions and a large network of 4160 genes containing all 7462 protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions in the yeast public databases. In the case of the small network, we identified five significant subnetworks that covered 41 out of 77 (53{\%}) of all significant changes in expression. Both network analyses returned several top-scoring subnetworks with good correspondence to known regulatory mechanisms in the literature. These results demonstrate how large-scale genomic approaches may be used to uncover signalling and regulatory pathways in a systematic, integrative fashion.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders have been shown to have deficits in sensorimotor gating as assessed by prepulse inhibition of the startle response. The authors hypothesized that nonschizophrenic relatives of patients with schizophrenia would also have prepulse inhibition deficits, thereby reflecting a genetically transmitted susceptibility to sensorimotor gating deficits. METHOD: Twenty-five comparison subjects, 23 patients with schizophrenia, 34 relatives of the schizophrenic patients, and 11 subjects with schizotypal personality disorder were assessed in an acoustic startle paradigm. The eye-blink component of the startle response was assessed bilaterally by using electromyographic recordings of orbicularis oculi. RESULTS: The patients with schizophrenia, their relatives, and subjects with schizotypal personality disorder all had reduced prepulse inhibition relative to comparison subjects, and these deficits were more evident in measures of right eye-blink prepulse inhibition. Comparison subjects demonstrated greater right versus left eye-blink prepulse inhibition, whereas the probands, their relatives, and subjects with schizotypal personality disorder showed less asymmetry of prepulse inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a genetically transmitted deficit in prepulse inhibition (sensorimotor gating) in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, including subjects with schizotypal personality disorder and relatives of patients with schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Currently, next-generation sequencing studies aim to identify rare and low-frequency variation that may contribute to disease. For a given effect size, as the allele frequency decreases, the power to detect genes or variants of interest also decreases. Although many methods have been proposed for the analysis of such data, study design and analytic issues still persist in data interpretation. In this study we present sequencing data for ABCA1 that has known rare variants associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). We contrast empirical findings from two study designs: a phenotypic extreme sample and a population-based random sample. We found differing strengths of association with HDL-C across the two study designs (P=0.0006 with n=701 phenotypic extremes vs P=0.03 with n=1600 randomly sampled individuals). To explore this apparent difference in evidence for association, we performed a simulation study focused on the impact of phenotypic selection on power. We demonstrate that the power gain for an extreme phenotypic selection study design is much greater in rare variant studies than for studies of common variants. Our study confirms that studying phenotypic extremes is critical in rare variant studies because it boosts power in two ways: the typical increases from extreme sampling and increasing the proportion of relevant functional variants ascertained and thereby tested for association. Furthermore, we show that when combining statistical evidence through meta-analysis from an extreme-selected sample and a second separate population-based random sample, power is lower when a traditional sample size weighting is used compared with weighting by the noncentrality parameter.European Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 9 September 2015; doi:10.1038/ejhg.2015.197.},

The model overcomes limitations of existing approaches to understanding, summarizing, and interpreting LD by (i) relating patterns of LD directly to the underlying recombination process; (ii) considering all loci simultaneously, rather than pairwise; (iii) avoiding the assumption that LD necessarily has a "block-like" structure; and (iv) being computationally tractable for huge genomic regions (up to complete chromosomes). We examine in detail one natural application of the model: estimation of underlying recombination rates from population data. Using simulation, we show that in the case where recombination is assumed constant across the region of interest, recombination rate estimates based on our model are competitive with the very best of current available methods. More importantly, we demonstrate, on real and simulated data, the potential of the model to help identify and quantify fine-scale variation in recombination rate from population data. We also outline how the model could be useful in other contexts, such as in the development of more efficient haplotype-based methods for LD mapping.},

abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are believed to have genetic and environmental origins, yet in only a modest fraction of individuals can specific causes be identified. To identify further genetic risk factors, here we assess the role of de novo mutations in ASD by sequencing the exomes of ASD cases and their parents (n = 175 trios). Fewer than half of the cases (46.3{\%}) carry a missense or nonsense de novo variant, and the overall rate of mutation is only modestly higher than the expected rate. In contrast, the proteins encoded by genes that harboured de novo missense or nonsense mutations showed a higher degree of connectivity among themselves and to previous ASD genes as indexed by protein-protein interaction screens. The small increase in the rate of de novo events, when taken together with the protein interaction results, are consistent with an important but limited role for de novo point mutations in ASD, similar to that documented for de novo copy number variants. Genetic models incorporating these data indicate that most of the observed de novo events are unconnected to ASD; those that do confer risk are distributed across many genes and are incompletely penetrant (that is, not necessarily sufficient for disease). Our results support polygenic models in which spontaneous coding mutations in any of a large number of genes increases risk by 5- to 20-fold. Despite the challenge posed by such models, results from de novo events and a large parallel case-control study provide strong evidence in favour of CHD8 and KATNAL2 as genuine autism risk factors.},

abstract = {Objective In addition to comparing drug treatment groups, the wealth of genetic and clinical data collected in the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness study offers tremendous opportunities to study individual differences in response to treatment with antipsychotics. A major challenge, however, is how to estimate the individual responses to treatments. For this purpose, we propose a systematic method that condenses all information collected during the trials in an optimal, empirical fashion. Methods Our method comprises three steps. First, we test how to best model treatment effects over time. Next, we screen many covariates to select those that will further improve the precision of the individual treatment effect estimates which, for example, improves power to detect predictors of individual treatment response. Third, Best Linear Unbiased Predictors (BLUPs) of the random effects are used to estimate for each individual a treatment effect based on the model empirically indicated to best fit the data. We illustrate our method for the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Results A model assuming it takes on average about 30 days for a treatment to exert an effect that will then remain about the same for the rest of the trial showed the best fit to the data. Of all screened covariates, only two improved the precision of the individual treatment effect estimates. Finally, correlations between drug effects and PANSS scales suggested that in CATIE it cannot be recommended to simply combine treatment effects across drugs (e.g. to study common drug mechanisms), but it is sensible to study how a given drug affects multiple symptom dimensions. Conclusions We demonstrate that treatment effects can be estimated in a way that condenses all information collected in an optimal, empirical fashion. We expect the proposed method to be valuable for other clinical outcomes in CATIE and potentially other clinical trials.},

abstract = {The power to detect disease-susceptibility loci through linkage analysis using pairs of affected relatives and affected-unaffected pairs is examined. Allelic identity by descent (ibd) for a completely polymorphic marker for sibling, uncle-nephew, grandparent-grandchild, half-sib, and first-cousin pairs is considered. Affected-unaffected pairs generally represent a poor strategy. For single-locus models, ibd depends on lambda R, the risk ratio for type R relatives compared with population prevalence, and the recombination fraction theta. The ibd for grandparent-grandchild pairs is least affected by recombination, followed by sibs, half-sib, uncle-nephew, and first-cousin pairs. For diseases with large lambda values and for small theta values, distant relatives offer greater power. For larger theta values, grandparent-grandchild pairs are best; for small lambda values, sibs are best. Additive and multiplicative multilocus models are considered. For the multiplicative model, the same formulas as in the single-locus model apply, except that lambda iR (for the ith contributing locus) is substituted for lambda R. For the additive model, the deviation from null expectation for ibd is divided among all contributing loci. Compared with the multiplicative model, for an additive model there is usually greater advantage in distant relationships. Multipoint analysis using linked marker loci for affected relative pairs is described. Simultaneous use of multiple markers diminishes the effect of recombination and allows for localization of the disease-susceptibility locus.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A number of studies have shown poorer survival among cancer patients with comorbidity. Several mechanisms may underlie this finding. In this review we summarize the current literature on the association between patient comorbidity and cancer prognosis. Prognostic factors examined include tumor biology, diagnosis, treatment, clinical quality, and adherence. METHODS: All English-language articles published during 2002–2012 on the association between comorbidity and survival among patients with colon cancer, breast cancer, and lung cancer were identified from PubMed, MEDLINE and Embase. Titles and abstracts were reviewed to identify eligible studies and their main results were then extracted. RESULTS: Our search yielded more than 2,500 articles related to comorbidity and cancer, but few investigated the prognostic impact of comorbidity as a primary aim. Most studies found that cancer patients with comorbidity had poorer survival than those without comorbidity, with 5-year mortality hazard ratios ranging from 1.1 to 5.8. Few studies examined the influence of specific chronic conditions. In general, comorbidity does not appear to be associated with more aggressive types of cancer or other differences in tumor biology. Presence of specific severe comorbidities or psychiatric disorders were found to be associated with delayed cancer diagnosis in some studies, while chronic diseases requiring regular medical visits were associated with earlier cancer detection in others. Another finding was that patients with comorbidity do not receive standard cancer treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy as often as patients without comorbidity, and their chance of completing a course of cancer treatment is lower. Postoperative complications and mortality are higher in patients with comorbidity. It is unclear from the literature whether the apparent undertreatment reflects appropriate consideration of greater toxicity risk, poorer clinical quality, patient preferences, or poor adherence among patients with comorbidity. CONCLUSION: Despite increasing recognition of the importance of comorbid illnesses among cancer patients, major challenges remain. Both treatment effectiveness and compliance appear compromised among cancer patients with comorbidity. Data on clinical quality is limited. },

abstract = {An emerging literature from epidemiologic, clinical, and preclinical investigations has provided evidence that gestational exposure to infection contributes to the etiology of schizophrenia. In recent years, these studies have moved from ecologic designs, which ascertain infection based on epidemics in populations, to investigations that have capitalized on reliable biomarkers in individual pregnancies. These studies have documented specific candidate infections that appear to be associated with an elevated risk of schizophrenia. Animal models of maternal immune activation inspired by this work have revealed intriguing findings indicating behavioral, neurochemical, and neurophysiologic abnormalities consistent with observations in schizophrenia. In parallel studies in humans and animals, investigators are working to uncover the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which in utero exposure to infection contributes to schizophrenia risk. In this review, the authors discuss and critically evaluate the epidemiologic literature on in utero exposure to infection and schizophrenia, summarize emerging animal models of maternal immune activation, and discuss putative unique and common mechanisms by which in utero exposure to infection alters neurodevelopment, potentially increasing susceptibility to schizophrenia. The promise of this work for facilitating the identification of susceptibility loci in genetic studies of schizophrenia is illustrated by examples of interaction between in utero exposure to infection and genetic variants. The authors then elaborate on possible implications of this work, including the use of preventive measures for reducing the incidence of schizophrenia. Finally, they discuss new approaches aimed at addressing current challenges in this area of research.},

abstract = {Non-biological experimental variation or "batch effects" are commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes ( > 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

abstract = {Disturbance to early brain development is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, schizophrenia, and mental retardation. Epidemiological studies have indicated that the risk of developing these disorders is enhanced by prenatal maternal infection, presumably as a result of neurodevelopmental defects triggered by cytokine-related inflammatory events. Here, we demonstrate that the effects of maternal immune challenge between middle and late gestation periods in mice are dissociable in terms of fetal brain cytokine responses to maternal inflammation and the pathological consequences in brain and behavior. Specifically, the relative expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the fetal brains in response to maternal immune challenge may be an important determinant among other developmental factors for the precise pathological profile emerging in later life. Thus, the middle and late gestation periods correspond to two windows with differing vulnerability to adult behavioral dysfunction, brain neuropathology in early adolescence, and of the acute cytokine responses in the fetal brain.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to determine whether prenatal exposure to infection and a positive family history of psychotic disorders interact synergistically to increase the risk of later developing schizophrenia. METHOD: The authors linked two national registers, the Medical Birth Register and the Finnish Population Register, to identify all women in Helsinki who received hospital treatment during pregnancy for an upper urinary tract infection (N=9,596) between 1947 and 1990. The Finnish Hospital Discharge Register was used to ascertain psychiatric outcomes in adulthood of offspring exposed to infection prenatally. Family history of psychotic disorders was determined by linking the Hospital Discharge Register and the Population Register. The authors used an additive statistical interaction model to calculate the amount of biological synergism between positive family history and prenatal exposure to infection. RESULTS: Prenatal exposure to infection did not significantly increase the risk of schizophrenia. However, the effect of prenatal exposure to pyelonephritis was five times greater in those who had a family history of psychosis compared to those who did not. The synergy analysis suggested that an estimated 38{\%}-46{\%} of the offspring who developed schizophrenia and had both prenatal exposure to infection and a positive family history of psychotic disorders did so as a result of the synergistic action of both risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support a mechanism of gene-environment interaction in the causation of schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia is a highly heritable, severe psychiatric disorder affecting approximately 1{\%} of the world population. A substantial portion of heritability is still unexplained and the pathophysiology of schizophrenia remains to be elucidated. To identify more schizophrenia susceptibility loci, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 498 patients with schizophrenia and 2025 controls from the Han Chinese population, and a follow-up study on 1027 cases and 1005 controls. In the follow-up study, we included 384 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which were selected from the top hits in our GWAS (130 SNPs) and from previously implicated loci for schizophrenia based on the SZGene database, NHGRI GWAS Catalog, copy number variation studies, GWAS meta-analysis results from the international Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) and candidate genes from plausible biological pathways (254 SNPs). Within the chromosomal region Xq28, SNP rs2269372 in RENBP achieved genome-wide significance with a combined P value of 3.98 x 10(-8) (OR of allele A = 1.31). SNPs with suggestive P values were identified within 2 genes that have been previously implicated in schizophrenia, MECP2 (rs2734647, P combined = 8.78 x 10(-7), OR = 1.28; rs2239464, P combined = 6.71 x 10(-6), OR = 1.26) and ARHGAP4 (rs2269368, P combined = 4.74 x 10(-7), OR = 1.25). In addition, the patient sample in our follow-up study showed a significantly greater burden for pre-defined risk alleles based on the SNPs selected than the controls. This indicates the existence of schizophrenia susceptibility loci among the SNPs we selected. This also further supports multigenic inheritance in schizophrenia. Our findings identified a new schizophrenia susceptibility locus on Xq28, which harbor the genes RENBP, MECP2, and ARHGAP4.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Previous studies of smoking habits of schizophrenic patients have found rates as high as 88{\%}. The authors report the smoking habits of all known schizophrenic patients within a discrete geographical area and compare them with the smoking habits of a general population sample. METHOD: All known schizophrenic patients in Nithsdale in South-West Scotland (N = 168) were invited to complete a questionnaire on smoking habits. Also assessed were mental state, drug-related side effects, and premorbid childhood personality and social adjustment. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-five of the 168 patients returned the questionnaires. The rate of smoking among the patients was 58{\%} (N = 78), compared with 28{\%} in the general population. Sixty-eight percent of the patients who smoked (N = 53) had 25 or more cigarettes per day. The mean age at starting smoking was 17 years in both patients and normal subjects. Ninety percent of the patients who smoked (N = 70) started smoking before the onset of schizophrenia. Patients who smoked were younger than nonsmokers, and more of them were male. They had had more hospitalizations, and more were in contact with psychiatric services. More were receiving intramuscular antipsychotic medication. Smokers had poorer childhood social adjustment. Among the female patients, there was a positive correlation between age at starting smoking and age at onset of schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of smoking and level of nicotine addiction are greater in schizophrenic patients than in the general population. Smoking may be a marker for the neurodevelopmental form of the illness and may be another environmental risk factor for schizophrenia in vulnerable individuals.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has been implicated in both working memory and the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. A relationship among dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity, working memory dysfunction, and symptoms in schizophrenia has not been firmly established, partly because of generalized cognitive impairments in patients and task complexity. Using tasks that parametrically manipulated working memory load, the authors tested three hypotheses: 1) patients with schizophrenia differ in prefrontal activity only when behavioral performance differentiates them from healthy comparison subjects, 2) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dysfunction is associated with poorer task performance, and 3) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dysfunction is associated with cognitive disorganization but not negative or positive symptoms. METHOD: Seventeen conventionally medicated patients with schizophrenia and 16 healthy comparison subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing multiple levels of the "n-back" sequential-letter working memory task. RESULTS: Patients with schizophrenia showed a deficit in physiological activation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's area 46/9) in the context of normal task-dependent activity in other regions, but only under the condition that distinguished them from comparison subjects on task performance. Patients with greater dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dysfunction performed more poorly. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dysfunction was selectively associated with disorganization symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with the hypotheses that working memory dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia is caused by a disturbance of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and that this disturbance is selectively associated with cognitive disorganization. Further, the pattern of behavioral performance suggests that dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dysfunction does not reflect a deficit in the maintenance of stimulus representations per se but points to deficits in more associative components of working memory.},

abstract = {The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia (SZ) has motivated a large number of genetic association studies but few if any dopaminergic (DA) polymorphisms are accepted as credible risk factors at present. To evaluate whether dopamine-related genes have been investigated adequately, we surveyed public genetic databases and published SZ association studies with regard to 14 conventional DA genes and 7 selected dopamine-interacting proteins. We estimate that 325 polymorphisms would be required to evaluate the impact of common variation on SZ risk among Caucasian samples. To date, 98 polymorphisms have been analyzed in published association studies. We estimate that only 19 of these variations have been evaluated in samples with at least 50{\%} power to detect an association of the effect size commonly found in genetically complex disorders. While it is possible that DA genes do not harbor genetic risk factors for SZ, our review suggests that satisfactory conclusions for most genes cannot be drawn at present. Whole-genome association studies have begun to fill this void, but additional analyses are likely to be needed. Recommendations for future association studies include analysis of adequately powered samples, judiciously selected polymorphisms, multiple ethnic groups, and concurrent evaluation of function at associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms. },

abstract = {Inherited alleles account for most of the genetic risk for schizophrenia. However, new (de novo) mutations, in the form of large chromosomal copy number changes, occur in a small fraction of cases and disproportionally disrupt genes encoding postsynaptic proteins. Here we show that small de novo mutations, affecting one or a few nucleotides, are overrepresented among glutamatergic postsynaptic proteins comprising activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (ARC) and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) complexes. Mutations are additionally enriched in proteins that interact with these complexes to modulate synaptic strength, namely proteins regulating actin filament dynamics and those whose messenger RNAs are targets of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Genes affected by mutations in schizophrenia overlap those mutated in autism and intellectual disability, as do mutation-enriched synaptic pathways. Aligning our findings with a parallel case-control study, we demonstrate reproducible insights into aetiological mechanisms for schizophrenia and reveal pathophysiology shared with other neurodevelopmental disorders.},

abstract = {This report compares the psycho-social adjustment of 47 adults born to schizophrenic mothers with 50 control adults, where all subjects had been separated from their natural mothers from the first few days of life. The comparison is based on a review of school, police, veterans, and hospital, among several other records, plus a personal interview and MMPI which were administered to 72 subjects. An I.Q. and social class determination were also available. Three psychiatrists independently rated the subjects.The results were:(1) Schizophrenic and sociopathic personality disorders were found in those persons born to schizophrenic persons in an excess exceeding chance expectation at the 0.05 level of probability. Five of 47 persons born to schizophrenic mothers were schizophrenic. No cases of schizophrenia were found in 50 control subjects.(2) Several other comparisons, such as persons given other psychiatric diagnoses, felons, and persons discharged from the Armed Forces for psychiatric or behavioural reasons, demonstrated a significant excess of psycho-social disability in about one-half of the persons born to schizophrenic mothers.(3) The remaining one-half of the persons born to schizophrenic mothers were notably successful adults. They possessed artistic talents and demonstrated imaginative adaptations to life which were uncommon in the control group.},

abstract = {Recently, the Mouse ENCODE Consortium reported that comparative gene expression data from human and mouse tend to cluster more by species rather than by tissue. This observation was surprising, as it contradicted much of the comparative gene regulatory data collected previously, as well as the common notion that major developmental pathways are highly conserved across a wide range of species, in particular across mammals. Here we show that the Mouse ENCODE gene expression data were collected using a flawed study design, which confounded sequencing batch (namely, the assignment of samples to sequencing flowcells and lanes) with species. When we account for the batch effect, the corrected comparative gene expression data from human and mouse tend to cluster by tissue, not by species.},

abstract = {The accurate mapping of reads that span splice junctions is a critical component of all analytic techniques that work with RNA-seq data. We introduce a second generation splice detection algorithm, MapSplice, whose focus is high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of splices as well as CPU and memory efficiency. MapSplice can be applied to both short (<75 bp) and long reads (>/= 75 bp). MapSplice is not dependent on splice site features or intron length, consequently it can detect novel canonical as well as non-canonical splices. MapSplice leverages the quality and diversity of read alignments of a given splice to increase accuracy. We demonstrate that MapSplice achieves higher sensitivity and specificity than TopHat and SpliceMap on a set of simulated RNA-seq data. Experimental studies also support the accuracy of the algorithm. Splice junctions derived from eight breast cancer RNA-seq datasets recapitulated the extensiveness of alternative splicing on a global level as well as the differences between molecular subtypes of breast cancer. These combined results indicate that MapSplice is a highly accurate algorithm for the alignment of RNA-seq reads to splice junctions.

Here we analyze a broad set of functional elements, including cell type-specific elements, to estimate their polygenic contributions to heritability in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 17 complex diseases and traits with an average sample size of 73,599. To enable this analysis, we introduce a new method, stratified LD score regression, for partitioning heritability from GWAS summary statistics while accounting for linked markers. This new method is computationally tractable at very large sample sizes and leverages genome-wide information. Our findings include a large enrichment of heritability in conserved regions across many traits, a very large immunological disease-specific enrichment of heritability in FANTOM5 enhancers and many cell type-specific enrichments, including significant enrichment of central nervous system cell types in the heritability of body mass index, age at menarche, educational attainment and smoking behavior.},

abstract = {An excess dopaminergic activity may be implicated in the etiology of schizophrenia. Our objective was to identify nucleotide variants in the 5' region of the dopamine D2 receptor gene (DRD2) and to clarify their effects on schizophrenia. We identified two polymorphisms, the A-241G and -141C Ins/Del, by examination of 259 bp in the 5'-flanking region and 249 bp of exon 1 of DRD2. Reporter constructs containing the -141C Del allele cloned into a luciferase reporter plasmid drove 21{\%} (Y-79 cells) and 43{\%} (293 cells) expression compared with the -141C Ins allele. In a case-control study, the -141C Del allele frequency was significantly lower in 260 schizophrenic patients than in 312 controls (OR = 0.60, 95{\%}CI 0.44-0.81, P < 0.001). No significant association was found between the A-241G polymorphism and in vitro luciferase activity, or in allele frequency between the patients versus controls. These findings show that the -141C Ins/Del may be a functional polymorphism in the 5'-promoter region of DRD2 and may affect the susceptibility to schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Mixed linear models are emerging as a method of choice for conducting genetic association studies in humans and other organisms. The advantages of the mixed-linear-model association (MLMA) method include the prevention of false positive associations due to population or relatedness structure and an increase in power obtained through the application of a correction that is specific to this structure. An underappreciated point is that MLMA can also increase power in studies without sample structure by implicitly conditioning on associated loci other than the candidate locus. Numerous variations on the standard MLMA approach have recently been published, with a focus on reducing computational cost. These advances provide researchers applying MLMA methods with many options to choose from, but we caution that MLMA methods are still subject to potential pitfalls. Here we describe and quantify the advantages and pitfalls of MLMA methods as a function of study design and provide recommendations for the application of these methods in practical settings.},

abstract = {The classical twin study is the most popular design in behavioural genetics. It has strong roots in biometrical genetic theory, which allows predictions to be made about the correlations between observed traits of identical and fraternal twins in terms of underlying genetic and environmental components. One can infer the relative importance of these 'latent' factors (model parameters) by structural equation modelling (SEM) of observed covariances of both twin types. SEM programs estimate model parameters by minimising a goodness-of-fit function between observed and predicted covariance matrices, usually by the maximum-likelihood criterion. Likelihood ratio statistics also allow the comparison of fit of different competing models. The program Mx, specifically developed to model genetically sensitive data, is now widely used in twin analyses. The flexibility of Mx allows the modelling of multivariate data to examine the genetic and environmental relations between two or more phenotypes and the modelling to categorical traits under liability-threshold models.},

abstract = {Maternal infection during prenatal life is a risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia and autism, in the offspring. We and others have reported white mater microstructure abnormalities in prefrontal-striato-temporal networks in these disorders. In addition we have shown that early rather than late maternal immune challenge in the mouse model precipitates ventricular volume change and impairs sensorimotor gating similar to that found in schizophrenia. However, it is not known whether the timing of maternal infection has a differential impact upon white matter microstructural indices. Therefore this study directly tested the effect of early or late gestation maternal immune activation on post-natal white matter microstructure in the mouse. The viral mimic PolyI:C was administered on day 9 or day 17 of gestation. In-vivo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was carried out when the offspring reached adulthood. We describe a novel application of voxel-based analysis to evaluate fractional anisotrophy (FA). In addition we conducted a preliminary immunohistochemical exploration of the oligodendrocyte marker, 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase), to determine whether differences in myelination might contribute to any changes in FA observed. Our results provide experimental evidence that prenatal exposure to inflammation elicits widespread differences in FA throughout fronto-striatal-limbic circuits compared to control saline exposure. Moreover, FA changes were more extensive in the group exposed earliest in gestation.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disease affecting about 1{\%} of the world's population, with significant effects on patients and society. Genetic studies have identified several candidate risk genes or genomic regions for schizophrenia, and epidemiological studies have revealed several environmental risk factors. However, the etiology of schizophrenia still remains largely unknown. Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone modifications can explain the interaction between genetic and environmental factors at the molecular level, and accumulating evidence suggests that such epigenetic alterations are involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. However, replication studies to validate previous findings and investigations of the causality of epigenetic alterations in schizophrenia are needed. Here, we review epigenetic studies of schizophrenia patients using postmortem brains or peripheral tissues, focusing mainly on DNA methylation. We also highlight the recent progress and challenges in characterizing the potentially complex and dynamic patterns of epigenomic variations. Such studies are expected to contribute to our understanding of schizophrenia etiology and should provide novel opportunities for the development of therapeutic drugs.},

abstract = {Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) are critical for the development of the nervous system. We previously discovered that FGF2 and EGF had opposite effects on motor neuron differentiation from human fetal neural stem cells (hNSCs), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that FGF2 and EGF differentially affect the temporal patterns of Akt and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3$\beta$) activation. High levels of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt activation accompanied with GSK3$\beta$ inactivation result in reduction of the motor neuron transcription factor HB9. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt by chemical inhibitors or RNA interference or overexpression of a constitutively active form of GSK3$\beta$ enhances HB9 expression. Consequently, PI3K inhibition increases hNSCs differentiation into HB9(+)/microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2)(+) motor neurons in vitro. More importantly, blocking PI3K not only enhances motor neuron differentiation from hNSCs grafted into the ventral horn of adult rat spinal cords, but also permits ectopic generation of motor neurons in the dorsal horn by overriding environmental influences. Our data suggest that FGF2 and EGF affect the motor neuron fate decision in hNSCs differently through a fine tuning of the PI3K/AKT/GSK3$\beta$ pathway, and that manipulation of this pathway can enhance motor neuron generation. },

abstract = {Although autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have a substantial genetic basis, most of the known genetic risk has been traced to rare variants, principally copy number variants (CNVs). To identify common risk variation, the Autism Genome Project (AGP) Consortium genotyped 1558 rigorously defined ASD families for 1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and analyzed these SNP genotypes for association with ASD. In one of four primary association analyses, the association signal for marker rs4141463, located within MACROD2, crossed the genome-wide association significance threshold of P < 5 x 10(-8). When a smaller replication sample was analyzed, the risk allele at rs4141463 was again over-transmitted; yet, consistent with the winner's curse, its effect size in the replication sample was much smaller; and, for the combined samples, the association signal barely fell below the P < 5 x 10(-8) threshold. Exploratory analyses of phenotypic subtypes yielded no significant associations after correction for multiple testing. They did, however, yield strong signals within several genes, KIAA0564, PLD5, POU6F2, ST8SIA2 and TAF1C.},

abstract = {Familial essential tremor (ET), the most common inherited movement disorder, is generally transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. A genome-wide scan for ET revealed one major locus on chromosome 3q13. Here, we report that the Ser9Gly variant in the dopamine D(3) receptor gene (DRD3), localized on 3q13.3, is associated and cosegregates with familial ET in 23 out of 30 French families. Sequencing revealed no other nonsynonymous variants in the DRD3-coding sequence and in the first 871 bp of the 5' flanking region. Moreover, Gly-9 homozygous patients presented with more severe and/or earlier onset forms of the disease than heterozygotes. A replication study comparing 276 patients with ET and 184 normal controls confirmed the association of the Gly-9 variant with risk and age-at-onset of ET. In human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293-transfected cells, the Gly-9 variant did not differ from the Ser-9 variant with respect to glycosylation and to anterograde and retrograde trafficking, but dopamine had an affinity that was four to five times higher. With the Gly-9 variant, the dopamine-mediated cAMP response was increased, and the mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK) signal was prolonged, as compared with the Ser-9 variant. The gain-of-function produced by the Gly-9 variant may explain why drugs active against tremor in Parkinson's disease (PD) are usually not effective in the treatment of ET and suggests that DRD3 partial agonists or antagonists should be considered as novel therapeutic options for patients with ET.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia is a common disease with a complex aetiology, probably involving multiple and heterogeneous genetic factors. Here, by analysing the exome sequences of 2,536 schizophrenia cases and 2,543 controls, we demonstrate a polygenic burden primarily arising from rare (less than 1 in 10,000), disruptive mutations distributed across many genes. Particularly enriched gene sets include the voltage-gated calcium ion channel and the signalling complex formed by the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated scaffold protein (ARC) of the postsynaptic density, sets previously implicated by genome-wide association and copy-number variation studies. Similar to reports in autism, targets of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP, product of FMR1) are enriched for case mutations. No individual gene-based test achieves significance after correction for multiple testing and we do not detect any alleles of moderately low frequency (approximately 0.5 to 1 per cent) and moderately large effect. Taken together, these data suggest that population-based exome sequencing can discover risk alleles and complements established gene-mapping paradigms in neuropsychiatric disease.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: It is expected that emerging digital gene expression (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Next-generation sequencing technologies generate millions of short sequence reads, which are usually aligned to a reference genome. In many applications, the key information required for downstream analysis is the number of reads mapping to each genomic feature, for example to each exon or each gene. The process of counting reads is called read summarization. Read summarization is required for a great variety of genomic analyses but has so far received relatively little attention in the literature. RESULTS: We present featureCounts, a read summarization program suitable for counting reads generated from either RNA or genomic DNA sequencing experiments. featureCounts implements highly efficient chromosome hashing and feature blocking techniques. It is considerably faster than existing methods (by an order of magnitude for gene-level summarization) and requires far less computer memory. It works with either single or paired-end reads and provides a wide range of options appropriate for different sequencing applications. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: featureCounts is available under GNU General Public License as part of the Subread (http://subread.sourceforge.net) or Rsubread (http://www.bioconductor.org) software packages.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:: Negative symptoms and diminished cognitive ability are also considered as core features of schizophrenia. There are many studies in which negative symptoms and cognitive impairments are individually treated with atypical antipsychotic in comparison with either a placebo or a typical antipsychotic. There is paucity of studies comparing the efficacy of olanzapine and amisulpride on improvement of negative symptoms and cognitive impairments. AIM:: To examine the effectiveness of amisulpride and olanzapine in treatment of negative symptoms and cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. MATERIALS AND METHODS:: Total 40 adult inpatients diagnosed as schizophrenia fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria were included in the study with their informed consent. These patients were recruited consecutively to one of the two drug regimen group, i.e. tab Amisulpride (100-300 mg/day) and tab Olanzapine (10-20 mg). Patients were evaluated on day 0 and day 60 with various rating scales like Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), Schizophrenia Cognition Rating Scale (SCoRS), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS), and three different scales to measure drug side effects. RESULTS:: The mean SANS score in amisulpride and olanzapine group at day 0 and day 60 were 83.89 (±12.67) and 21.00 (±11.82) and 84.40 (±13.22) and 26.75 (±12.41), respectively. The mean rank of SCoRS global in amisulpride and olanzapine group at day 0 and day 60 were 4.78 (±1.13) and 2.78 (±0.63) and 4.85 (±1.18) and 3.30 (±1.12), respectively. The percentage improvement in SANS, SAPS, SCoRS interviewer, and SCoRS global in amisulpride group are 74.96{\%}, 13.36{\%}, 54.14{\%}, and 42.00{\%}, respectively. Similarly in olanzapine group percentage improvement in SANS, SAPS, SCoRS interviewer, and SCoRS global are 68.30{\%}, 30.28{\%}, 35.22{\%}, and 31.95{\%}, respectively. There is significant improvement in SANS, SCoRS, SAS, BPRS, and PANSS (Insight) in both amisulpride and olanzapine groups at the two time points. However, there is no significant difference between amisulpride and olanzapine group of patients. CONCLUSION:: Both amisulpride and olanzapine group patients showed significant improvement in negative and cognitive symptoms from baseline to endpoint, but there was no significant difference between amisulpride and olanzapine group of patients. },

abstract = {RATIONALE: Antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism (AIP) is a severe adverse affect of neuroleptic treatment. Interindividual heterogeneity in AIP development and severity is associated with risk factors such as antipsychotic drug type, old age, and female gender. There is evidence for genetic predisposition to develop AIP but the variants that confer susceptibility or protection are mostly unknown. OBJECTIVE: To identify genes related to AIP susceptibility, we performed a pharmacogenomic genome-wide association study (GWAS) for AIP severity. METHODS: Three hundred ninety-seven American schizophrenia patients who participated in the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE)-GWAS project were included in our analysis. Patients had been randomized to treatment with antipsychotic monotherapy for periods ranging from 2 weeks to 18 months during phase 1 of the CATIE trial. They were regularly assessed for AIP severity using the modified Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS). For statistical analysis, patients were dichotomized as cases (average SAS mean global score > 0.3 during CATIE phase 1, N = 199) or controls (average SAS mean global score 0, N = 198). RESULTS: Using logistic regression and controlling for population stratification, age, gender, SAS score at baseline, and concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs, we identified several single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with AIP severity. Although none reached the GWAS significance level of P < 4.2 x 10(-7), some promising candidate genes for further research on genetic predisposition to AIP were identified including EPF1, NOVA1, and FIGN. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding may contribute to understanding of the pathophysiology of AIP as well as to a priori identification of patients vulnerable for development of AIP.},

However, the mechanism by which MIA causes long-term behavioral deficits in the offspring is unknown. Here we show that the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) is critical for mediating the behavioral and transcriptional changes in the offspring. A single maternal injection of IL-6 on day 12.5 of mouse pregnancy causes prepulse inhibition (PPI) and latent inhibition (LI) deficits in the adult offspring. Moreover, coadministration of an anti-IL-6 antibody in the poly(I:C) model of MIA prevents the PPI, LI, and exploratory and social deficits caused by poly(I:C) and normalizes the associated changes in gene expression in the brains of adult offspring. Finally, MIA in IL-6 knock-out mice does not result in several of the behavioral changes seen in the offspring of wild-type mice after MIA. The identification of IL-6 as a key intermediary should aid in the molecular dissection of the pathways whereby MIA alters fetal brain development, which can shed new light on the pathophysiological mechanisms that predispose to schizophrenia and autism.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Antipsychotic drug is the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia, and there are large inter-individual differences in clinical response and side effects. Pharmacogenetics provides a valuable tool to fulfill the promise of personalized medicine by tailoring treatment based on one's genetic markers. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: This article reviews the pharmacogenetic literature from early 1990s to 2010, focusing on two aspects of drug action: pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Genetic variants in the neurotransmitter receptors including dopamine and 5-HT and metabolic pathways of drugs including CYP2D6 and COMT were discussed in association with clinical drug response and side effects. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: Readers are expected to learn the up-to-date evidence in pharmacogenetic research and to gain familiarity to the issues and challenges facing the field. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Pharmacogenetic research of antipsychotic drugs is both promising and challenging. There is consistent evidence that some genetic variants can affect clinical response and side effects. However, more studies that are designed specifically to test pharmacogenetic hypotheses are clearly needed to advance the field.},

abstract = {Recent systematic reviews have encouraged the psychiatric research community to reevaluate the contours of schizophrenia epidemiology. This paper provides a concise overview of three related systematic reviews on the incidence, prevalence, and mortality associated with schizophrenia. The reviews shared key methodological features regarding search strategies, analysis of the distribution of the frequency estimates, and exploration of the influence of key variables (sex, migrant status, urbanicity, secular trend, economic status, and latitude). Contrary to previous interpretations, the incidence of schizophrenia shows prominent variation between sites. The median incidence of schizophrenia was 15.2/100,000 persons, and the central 80{\%} of estimates varied over a fivefold range (7.7–43.0/100,000). The rate ratio for males:females was 1.4:1. Prevalence estimates also show prominent variation. The median lifetime morbid risk for schizophrenia was 7.2/1,000 persons. On the basis of the standardized mortality ratio, people with schizophrenia have a two- to threefold increased risk of dying (median standardized mortality ratio = 2.6 for all-cause mortality), and this differential gap in mortality has increased over recent decades. Compared with native-born individuals, migrants have an increased incidence and prevalence of schizophrenia. Exposures related to urbanicity, economic status, and latitude are also associated with various frequency measures. In conclusion, the epidemiology of schizophrenia is characterized by prominent variability and gradients that can help guide future research. },

These findings have led to the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia. Here we review the evidence for this hypothesis in postmortem studies of brain tissue from individuals affected by schizophrenia, summarizing studies of glutamate neuron morphology, of expression of glutamate receptors and transporters, and of the synthesizing and metabolizing enzymes for glutamate and its co-agonists. We found consistent evidence of morphological alterations of dendrites of glutamatergic neurons in the cerebral cortex of subjects with schizophrenia and of reduced levels of the axon bouton marker synaptophysin. There were no consistent alterations of mRNA expression of glutamate receptors, although there has been limited study of the corresponding proteins. Studies of the glutamate metabolic pathway have been limited, although there is some evidence that excitatory amino acid transporter-2, glutamine synthetase, and glutaminase have altered expression in schizophrenia. Future studies would benefit from additional direct examination of glutamatergic proteins. Further advances, such as selective testing of synaptic microdomains, cortical layers, and neuronal subtypes, may also be required to elucidate the nature of glutamate signaling impairments in schizophrenia.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A converging body of evidence implicates the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter system in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. METHODS: The authors review neuroscience literature and clinical studies investigating the role of the GABA system in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. First, a background on the GABA system is provided, including GABA pharmacology and neuroanatomy of GABAergic neurons. Results from basic science schizophrenia animal models and human studies are reviewed. The role of GABA in cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia is then presented, followed by a discussion of GABAergic compounds used in monotherapy or adjunctively in clinical schizophrenia studies. RESULTS: In basic studies, reductions in GABAergic neuronal density and abnormalities in receptors and reuptake sites have been identified in several cortical and subcortical GABA systems. A model has been developed suggesting GABA's role (including GABA-dopamine interactions) in schizophrenia. In several clinical studies, the use of adjunctive GABA agonists was associated with greater improvement in core schizophrenia symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in the GABA neurotransmitter system are found in clinical and basic neuroscience schizophrenia studies as well as animal models and may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The interaction of GABA with other well-characterized neurotransmitter abnormalities remains to be understood. Future studies should elucidate the potential therapeutic role for GABA ligands in schizophrenia treatment.},

abstract = {Early and effective treatment in first-episode schizophrenia is associated with better outcomes. Evidence suggests that response is generally robust in a first antipsychotic trial, but a marked reduction in response rate is observed among patients for whom a second trial is warranted, and even further reductions are seen in subsequent trials. Clozapine, the treatment of choice in refractory schizophrenia, is routinely employed only as a third-line treatment, and it has been shown to markedly enhance the rate of response, even when compared with other atypical antipsychotics. This raises the question of whether clozapine would be more effectively positioned as a first-line treatment. Current evidence addressing this question does not support this position, although the limited data available and methodological issues preclude a firm conclusion. Practical issues related to clozapine use, in combination with the robust response reported for other agents when used as first-line treatment, certainly call into question the likelihood that clozapine would be chosen if it were an option at this stage. In contrast, the notable reduction in response rate to second-line treatments, coupled with clozapine's substantial response rate in refractory schizophrenia and evidence indicating better outcomes with early, effective treatment, makes a compelling argument for research examining clinical and functional outcomes with clozapine positioned as a second-line treatment.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Maternal infection during pregnancy increases risk of severe neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and autism, in the offspring. The most consistent brain structural abnormality in patients with schizophrenia is enlarged lateral ventricles. However, it is unknown whether the aetiology of ventriculomegaly in schizophrenia involves prenatal infectious processes. The present experiments tested the hypothesis that there is a causal relationship between prenatal immune challenge and emergence of ventricular abnormalities relevant to schizophrenia in adulthood. METHOD: We used an established mouse model of maternal immune activation (MIA) by the viral mimic PolyI:C administered in early (day 9) or late (day 17) gestation. Automated voxel-based morphometry mapped cerebrospinal fluid across the whole brain of adult offspring and the results were validated by manual region-of-interest tracing of the lateral ventricles. Parallel behavioral testing determined the existence of schizophrenia-related sensorimotor gating abnormalities. RESULTS: PolyI:C-induced immune activation, in early but not late gestation, caused marked enlargement of lateral ventricles in adulthood, without affecting total white and grey matter volumes. This early exposure disrupted sensorimotor gating, in the form of prepulse inhibition. Identical immune challenge in late gestation resulted in significant expansion of 4(th) ventricle volume but did not disrupt sensorimotor gating. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide the first experimental evidence that prenatal immune activation is an environmental risk factor for adult ventricular enlargement relevant to schizophrenia. The data indicate immune-associated environmental insults targeting early foetal development may have more extensive neurodevelopmental impact than identical insults in late prenatal life.},

abstract = {Recent studies suggest that genetic and environmental factors do not account for all the schizophrenia risk, and epigenetics also has a role in disease susceptibility. DNA methylation is a heritable epigenetic modification that can regulate gene expression. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed on post-mortem human brain tissue from 24 patients with schizophrenia and 24 unaffected controls. DNA methylation was assessed at over 485[thinsp]000 CpG sites using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Bead Chip. After adjusting for age and post-mortem interval, 4641 probes corresponding to 2929 unique genes were found to be differentially methylated. Of those genes, 1291 were located in a CpG island and 817 were in a promoter region. These include NOS1, AKT1, DTNBP1, DNMT1, PPP3CC and SOX10, which have previously been associated with schizophrenia. More than 100 of these genes overlap with a previous DNA methylation study of peripheral blood from schizophrenia patients in which 27[thinsp]000 CpG sites were analysed. Unsupervised clustering analysis of the top 3000 most variable probes revealed two distinct groups with significantly more people with schizophrenia in cluster one compared with controls (P=1.74 [times] 10-4). The first cluster composed of 88{\%} of patients with schizophrenia and only 12{\%} controls, whereas the second cluster composed of 27{\%} of patients with schizophrenia and 73{\%} controls. These results strongly suggest that differential DNA methylation is important in schizophrenia etiology and add support for the use of DNA methylation profiles as a future prognostic indicator of schizophrenia.},

Several mouse models of maternal immune activation (MIA) were used to examine the immediate effects of MIA induced by influenza virus, poly(I:C) and interleukin IL-6 on the fetal brain transcriptome. Our results indicate that all three MIA treatments lead to strong and common gene expression changes in the embryonic brain. Most notably, there is an acute and transient upregulation of the $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ crystallin gene family. Furthermore, levels of crystallin gene expression are correlated with the severity of MIA as assessed by placental weight. The overall gene expression changes suggest that the response to MIA is a neuroprotective attempt by the developing brain to counteract environmental stress, but at a cost of disrupting typical neuronal differentiation and axonal growth. We propose that this cascade of events might parallel the mechanisms by which environmental insults contribute to the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia and autism.},

Northern blot analysis revealed that the sgk mRNA level was approximately 4-fold higher in the hippocampus of fast learners than slow learners. In situ hybridization results indicated that sgk mRNA level was increased markedly in CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus of hippocampus in fast learners. Transient transfection of the sgk mutant DNA to the CA1 area impaired, whereas transfection of the sgk wild-type DNA facilitated water maze performance in rats. These results provide direct evidence that enhanced sgk expression facilitates memory consolidation of spatial learning in rats.

abstract = {Schizophrenia is an often devastating neuropsychiatric illness. Understanding the genetic variation affecting response to antipsychotics is important to develop novel diagnostic tests to match individual schizophrenia patients to the most effective and safe medication. In this study, we use a genome-wide approach to detect genetic variation underlying individual differences in response to treatment with the antipsychotics olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone and perphenazine. Our sample consisted of 738 subjects with DSM-IV schizophrenia who took part in the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness. Subjects were genotyped using the Affymetrix 500 K genotyping platform plus a custom 164 K chip to improve genome-wide coverage. Treatment outcome was measured using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Our criterion for genome-wide significance was a prespecified threshold that ensures that, on an average, only 10{\%} of the significant findings are false discoveries. The top statistical result reached significance at our prespecified threshold and involved a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in an intergenic region on chromosome 4p15. In addition, SNPs in Ankyrin Repeat and Sterile Alpha Motif Domain-Containing Protein 1B (ANKS1B) and in the Contactin-Associated Protein-Like 5 gene (CNTNAP5), which mediated the effects of olanzapine and risperidone on Negative symptoms, were very close to our threshold for declaring significance. The most significant SNP in CNTNAP5 is nonsynonymous, giving rise to an amino-acid substitution. In addition to highlighting our top results, we provide all P-values for download as a resource for investigators with the requisite samples to carry out replication. This study demonstrates the potential of genome-wide association studies to discover novel genes that mediate the effects of antipsychotics, which could eventually help to tailor drug treatment to schizophrenic patients.},

abstract = {In order to investigate linkage detection strategies for genetically complex traits, multilocus models of inheritance need to be specified. Here, two types of multilocus model are described: (1) a multiplicative model, representing epistasis (interaction) among loci, and (2) an additive model, which is shown to closely approximate genetic heterogeneity, which is characterized by no interlocus interaction. A ratio lambda R of risk for type R relatives that is compared with population prevalence is defined. For a single-locus model, lambda R - 1 decreases by a factor of two with each degree of relationship. The same holds true for an additive multilocus model. For a multiplicative (epistasis) model, lambda R - 1 decreases more rapidly than by a factor of two with degree of relationship. Examination of lambda R values for various classes of relatives can potentially suggest the presence of multiple loci and epistasis. For example, data for schizophrenia suggest multiple loci in interaction. It is shown in the second paper of this series that lambda R is the critical parameter in determining power to detect linkage by using affected relative pairs.},

abstract = {Increased dietary consumption of the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) eicosapentaenoic acid (20 : 5n-3; EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (22 : 6n-6; DHA) is associated with their incorporation into circulating phospholipid and increased production of lipid peroxide metabolites. The relationship between peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) function, n-3 PUFA intake and antioxidant co-supplementation is poorly defined. We therefore investigated tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL) 6 production by PBMC and phospholipid fatty acid composition in plasma and erythrocytes of healthy male subjects (n 16) receiving supplemental intakes of 0.3, 1.0 and 2.0 g EPA+DHA/d, as consecutive 4-week courses. All subjects were randomised in a double-blind manner to receive a concurrent antioxidant supplement (200 microg Se, 3 mg Mn, 30 mg D-alpha-tocopheryl succinate, 90 mg ascorbic acid, 450 microg vitamin A (beta-carotene and retinol)) or placebo. There was a positive dose-dependent relationship between dietary n-3 PUFA intake and EPA and DHA incorporation into plasma phosphatidylcholine and erythrocyte phosphatidylethanolamine, with a tendency towards a plateau at higher levels of intake. Production of TNF-alpha and IL-6 by PBMC decreased with increasing n-3 PUFA intake but tended towards a 'U-shaped' dose response. Both responses appeared to be augmented by antioxidant co-supplementation at intermediate supplementary n-3 PUFA intakes. Thus, increased dietary n-3 PUFA consumption resulted in defined but contrasting patterns of modulation of phospholipid fatty acid composition and PBMC function, which were further influenced by antioxidant intake.},

abstract = {Identifying genetic correlations between complex traits and diseases can provide useful etiological insights and help prioritize likely causal relationships. The major challenges preventing estimation of genetic correlation from genome-wide association study (GWAS) data with current methods are the lack of availability of individual-level genotype data and widespread sample overlap among meta-analyses. We circumvent these difficulties by introducing a technique[mdash]cross-trait LD Score regression[mdash]for estimating genetic correlation that requires only GWAS summary statistics and is not biased by sample overlap. We use this method to estimate 276 genetic correlations among 24 traits. The results include genetic correlations between anorexia nervosa and schizophrenia, anorexia and obesity, and educational attainment and several diseases. These results highlight the power of genome-wide analyses, as there currently are no significantly associated SNPs for anorexia nervosa and only three for educational attainment.},

abstract = {Prenatal exposure to maternal immune activation (MIA) increases the risk of schizophrenia and autism in the offspring. The MIA rodent model provides a valuable tool to directly test the postnatal consequences of exposure to an early inflammatory insult; and examine novel preventative strategies. Here we tested the hypotheses that behavioural differences in the MIA mouse model are accompanied by in vivo and ex vivo alterations in brain biochemistry; and that these can be prevented by a post-weaning diet enriched with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). The viral analogue PolyI:C (POL) or saline (SAL) was administered to pregnant mice on gestation day 9. Half the resulting male offspring (POL=21; SAL=17) were weaned onto a conventional lab diet (n-6 PUFA); half were weaned onto n-3 PUFA-enriched diet. In vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy measures were acquired prior to behavioural tests; glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) and tyrosine hydroxylase protein levels were measured ex vivo. The main findings were: (i) Adult MIA-exposed mice fed a standard diet had greater N-acetylaspartate/creatine (Cr) and lower myo-inositol/Cr levels in the cingulate cortex in vivo. (ii) The extent of these metabolite differences was correlated with impairment in prepulse inhibition. (iii) MIA-exposed mice on the control diet also had higher levels of anxiety and altered levels of GAD67 ex vivo. (iv) An n-3 PUFA diet prevented all the in vivo and ex vivo effects of MIA observed. Thus, n-3 PUFA dietary enrichment from early life may offer a relatively safe and non-toxic approach to limit the otherwise persistent behavioural and biochemical consequences of prenatal exposure to inflammation. This result may have translational importance.},

abstract = {The role of the D(3) receptor has remained largely elusive before the development of selective research tools, such as selective radioligands, antibodies, various highly specific pharmacological agents and knock-out mice. The data collected so far with these tools have removed some of the uncertainties regarding the functions mediated by the D(3) receptor. The D(3) receptor is an autoreceptor that controls the phasic, but not tonic activity of dopamine neurons. The D(3) receptor, via regulation of its expression by the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), mediates sensitization to dopamine indirect agonists. This process seems responsible for side-effects of levodopa (dyskinesia) in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), as well as for some aspects of conditioning to drugs of abuse. The D(3) receptor mediates behavioral abnormalities elicited by glutamate/NMDA receptor blockade, which suggests D(3) receptor-selective antagonists as novel antipsychotic drugs. These data allow us to propose novel treatment options in PD, schizophrenia and drug addiction, which are awaiting evaluation in clinical trials.},

The designs, however, did not incorporate observations of the rearing-family environment. Aims To test the hypothesis that genetic factors moderate susceptibility to environmentally mediated risks associated with rearing-family functioning. Method A Finnish national sample of adopted-away offspring of mothers with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders was compared blindly with adoptees without this genetic risk. Adoptive rearing was assessed using family rating scales based upon extended family observations at initial assessment. Adoptees were independently re-diagnosed after a median interval of12 years, with register follow-up after 21 years. Results In adoptees at high genetic risk of schizophrenia, but not in those at low genetic risk, adoptive-family ratings were a significant predictor of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders in adoptees at long-term follow-up. Conclusions Adoptees at high genetic risk are significantly more sensitive to adverse v. ‘healthy’ rearing patterns in adoptive families than are adoptees at low genetic risk.},

Clozapine is metabolized primarily by CYP1A2, with additional contributions by CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Risperidone is metabolized primarily by CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4; the 9-hydroxy metabolite of risperidone (paliperidone) is now marketed as an antipsychotic in its own right. Olanzapine is metabolized primarily by direct glucuronidation and CYP1A2 and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Quetiapine is metabolized by CYP3A4, as is ziprasidone, although in the latter case aldehyde oxidase is the enzyme responsible for most of the metabolism. CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 are important in the metabolism of aripiprazole, and CYP-catalyzed metabolism of paliperidone and amisulpride appears to be minor. At the usual clinical doses, these drugs appear to not generally affect markedly the metabolism of other coadministered medications. However, as indicated above, several of atypical antipsychotics are metabolized by CYP enzymes, and physicians should be aware of coadministered drugs that may inhibit or induce these CYP enzymes; examples of such possible interactions are presented in this review.},

abstract = {So-called ‘drug-metabolizing enzyme’ (DME) genes have existed on this planet for more than 2.5 billion years and would be more appropriately named ‘effector-metabolizing enzymes’. Genes encoding DMEs have functioned in many fundamental processes in prokaryotes and, more recently, in countless critical life processes in plants and animals. DME genes exist in every eukaryotic cell and in most, if not all, prokaryotes. Over the past decade, it has become clear that each person has their own ‘individual fingerprint’ of unique alleles coding for DMEs. The underlying genetic predisposition of each patient reflects combinations of poor- and extensive-metabolizer phenotypes. If these enzymes cooperate in the same metabolic pathway for any given drug or environmental agent, such ecogenetic variability might be synergistic and could cause 30- to >40-fold differences in activation or degradation. The end result can be large interindividual differences in risk of environmentally caused toxicity or cancer. Human DME gene polymorphisms often show high frequencies of variant alleles. Many factors contribute to persistence of these high frequencies, including a combination of selective pressures involving diet, climate and geography, as well as ‘balanced polymorphisms’ (‘shared benefit’ for the heterozygote). However, the extensive heterogeneity in the human genome currently being discovered suggests many more polymorphisms will occur not only in drug metabolism genes, but in all genes, and exhibiting large gene-by-gene variability.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS: To align our large (>80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of >50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 x 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90{\%} success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code.

Here, we describe an application of the Illumina sequencing (formerly Solexa sequencing) platform to study mRNA expression levels. Our goals were to estimate technical variance associated with Illumina sequencing in this context and to compare its ability to identify differentially expressed genes with existing array technologies. To do so, we estimated gene expression differences between liver and kidney RNA samples using multiple sequencing replicates, and compared the sequencing data to results obtained from Affymetrix arrays using the same RNA samples. We find that the Illumina sequencing data are highly replicable, with relatively little technical variation, and thus, for many purposes, it may suffice to sequence each mRNA sample only once (i.e., using one lane). The information in a single lane of Illumina sequencing data appears comparable to that in a single array in enabling identification of differentially expressed genes, while allowing for additional analyses such as detection of low-expressed genes, alternative splice variants, and novel transcripts. Based on our observations, we propose an empirical protocol and a statistical framework for the analysis of gene expression using ultra-high-throughput sequencing technology.},

In birth cohort studies conducted by our group and others, in utero exposure to infectious agents, prospectively obtained after biomarker assays of archived maternal sera and by obstetric records was related to an increased risk of schizophrenia. Thus far, it has been demonstrated that prenatal exposure to influenza, increased toxoplasma antibody, genital-reproductive infections, rubella, and other pathogens are associated with schizophrenia. Anomalies of the immune system, including enhanced maternal cytokine levels, are also related to schizophrenia. Some evidence also suggests that maternal infection and immune dysfunction may be associated with autism. Although replication is required, these findings suggest that public health interventions targeting infectious exposures have the potential for preventing cases of schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, this work has stimulated translational research on the neurobiological and genetic determinants of these conditions.},
