	abstract = {Cytokines have been recognized to play an important role both in normal development of the brain, when they act as neurotrophic factors, as well as following injury. While both the cytokines and their receptors are synthesized and expressed in the brain normally (albeit at low levels), it has become clear that elevated levels are associated with many neurological disorders. In this review, we have chosen to present the data for only a few of the cytokines, including interleukin-1beta, interleukin-3, interleukin-6, interferon-gamma, transforming growth factor-beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Data are presented that suggest roles they may play in human disorders, including stroke, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and several psychiatric disorders. The results in human disease are compared with results obtained in a variety of transgenic animal models. The mouse models have very different disorders depending on whether a cytokine is overexpressed either peripherally or in either astrocytes or neurons. The potential significance of this to the understanding of human disease is discussed.},

	abstract = {Maternal infection during pregnancy increases the risk of schizophrenia and other brain disorders of neurodevelopmental origin in the offspring. A multitude of infectious agents seem to be involved in this association. Therefore, it has been proposed that factors common to the immune response to a wide variety of bacterial and viral pathogens may be the critical link between prenatal infection and postnatal brain and behavioral pathology. More specifically, it has been suggested that the maternal induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines may mediate the neurodevelopmental effects of maternal infections. Here, we review recent findings from in vitro and in vivo investigations supporting this hypothesis and further emphasize the influence of enhanced anti-inflammatory cytokine signaling on early brain development. Disruption of the fetal brain balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine signaling may thus represent a key mechanism involved in the precipitation of schizophrenia-related pathology following prenatal maternal infection and innate immune imbalances.},

@article{Szatkiewicz2014,
	abstract = {Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a highly heritable neuropsychiatric disorder of complex genetic etiology. Previous genome-wide surveys have revealed a greater burden of large, rare copy number variations (CNVs) in SCZ cases and identified multiple rare recurrent CNVs that increase risk of SCZ although with incomplete penetrance and pleiotropic effects. Identification of additional recurrent CNVs and biological pathways enriched for SCZ CNVs requires greater sample sizes. We conducted a genome-wide survey for CNVs associated with SCZ using a Swedish national sample (4719 cases and 5917 controls). High-confidence CNV calls were generated using genotyping array intensity data, and their effect on risk of SCZ was measured. Our data confirm increased burden of large, rare CNVs in SCZ cases as well as significant associations for recurrent 16p11.2 duplications, 22q11.2 deletions and 3q29 deletions. We report a novel association for 17q12 duplications (odds ratio=4.16, P=0.018), previously associated with autism and mental retardation but not SCZ. Intriguingly, gene set association analyses implicate biological pathways previously associated with SCZ through common variation and exome sequencing (calcium channel signaling and binding partners of the fragile X mental retardation protein). We found significantly increased burden of the largest CNVs (>500[thinsp]kb) in genes present in the postsynaptic density, in genomic regions implicated via SCZ genome-wide association studies and in gene products localized to mitochondria and cytoplasm. Our findings suggest that multiple lines of genomic inquiry[mdash]genome-wide screens for CNVs, common variation and exonic variation[mdash]are converging on similar sets of pathways and/or genes.},

@article{Zheng2006,
	abstract = {Population-based case-control studies are a useful method to test for a genetic association between a trait and a marker. However, the analysis of the resulting data can be affected by population stratification or cryptic relatedness, which may inflate the variance of the usual statistics, resulting in a higher-than-nominal rate of false-positive results. One approach to preserving the nominal type I error is to apply genomic control, which adjusts the variance of the Cochran-Armitage trend test by calculating the statistic on data from null loci. This enables one to estimate any additional variance in the null distribution of statistics. When the underlying genetic model (e.g., recessive, additive, or dominant) is known, genomic control can be applied to the corresponding optimal trend tests. In practice, however, the mode of inheritance is unknown. The genotype-based chi (2) test for a general association between the trait and the marker does not depend on the underlying genetic model. Since this general association test has 2 degrees of freedom (df), the existing formulas for estimating the variance factor by use of genomic control are not directly applicable. By expressing the general association test in terms of two Cochran-Armitage trend tests, one can apply genomic control to each of the two trend tests separately, thereby adjusting the chi (2) statistic. The properties of this robust genomic control test with 2 df are examined by simulation. This genomic control-adjusted 2-df test has control of type I error and achieves reasonable power, relative to the optimal tests for each model.},

	abstract = {The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia (SZ) has motivated a large number of genetic association studies but few if any dopaminergic (DA) polymorphisms are accepted as credible risk factors at present. To evaluate whether dopamine-related genes have been investigated adequately, we surveyed public genetic databases and published SZ association studies with regard to 14 conventional DA genes and 7 selected dopamine-interacting proteins. We estimate that 325 polymorphisms would be required to evaluate the impact of common variation on SZ risk among Caucasian samples. To date, 98 polymorphisms have been analyzed in published association studies. We estimate that only 19 of these variations have been evaluated in samples with at least 50\% power to detect an association of the effect size commonly found in genetically complex disorders. While it is possible that DA genes do not harbor genetic risk factors for SZ, our review suggests that satisfactory conclusions for most genes cannot be drawn at present. Whole-genome association studies have begun to fill this void, but additional analyses are likely to be needed. Recommendations for future association studies include analysis of adequately powered samples, judiciously selected polymorphisms, multiple ethnic groups, and concurrent evaluation of function at associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms. },

The designs, however, did not incorporate observations of the rearing-family environment. Aims To test the hypothesis that genetic factors moderate susceptibility to environmentally mediated risks associated with rearing-family functioning. Method A Finnish national sample of adopted-away offspring of mothers with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders was compared blindly with adoptees without this genetic risk. Adoptive rearing was assessed using family rating scales based upon extended family observations at initial assessment. Adoptees were independently re-diagnosed after a median interval of12 years, with register follow-up after 21 years. Results In adoptees at high genetic risk of schizophrenia, but not in those at low genetic risk, adoptive-family ratings were a significant predictor of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders in adoptees at long-term follow-up. Conclusions Adoptees at high genetic risk are significantly more sensitive to adverse v. ‘healthy’ rearing patterns in adoptive families than are adoptees at low genetic risk.},

We conducted a multi-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) for schizophrenia beginning with a Swedish national sample (5,001 cases and 6,243 controls) followed by meta-analysis with previous schizophrenia GWAS (8,832 cases and 12,067 controls) and finally by replication of SNPs in 168 genomic regions in independent samples (7,413 cases, 19,762 controls and 581 parent-offspring trios). We identified 22 loci associated at genome-wide significance; 13 of these are new, and 1 was previously implicated in bipolar disorder. Examination of candidate genes at these loci suggests the involvement of neuronal calcium signaling. We estimate that 8,300 independent, mostly common SNPs (95\% credible interval of 6,300-10,200 SNPs) contribute to risk for schizophrenia and that these collectively account for at least 32\% of the variance in liability. Common genetic variation has an important role in the etiology of schizophrenia, and larger studies will allow more detailed understanding of this disorder.},

In many applications, the key information required for downstream analysis is the number of reads mapping to each genomic feature, for example to each exon or each gene. The process of counting reads is called read summarization. Read summarization is required for a great variety of genomic analyses but has so far received relatively little attention in the literature. RESULTS: We present featureCounts, a read summarization program suitable for counting reads generated from either RNA or genomic DNA sequencing experiments. featureCounts implements highly efficient chromosome hashing and feature blocking techniques. It is considerably faster than existing methods (by an order of magnitude for gene-level summarization) and requires far less computer memory. It works with either single or paired-end reads and provides a wide range of options appropriate for different sequencing applications.

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS: To align our large (>80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of >50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 x 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90{\%} success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.

	abstract = {To determine whether dietary fat intake during childhood affects the later risk of developing breast cancer, we fed prepubertal rats between post-natal days 5 and 25 a low (16{\%} energy) or high-fat (39{\%} energy) diet composed mainly of n-6 or n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) originating either from corn oil or menhaden oil, respectively, in the ratios of 16-17:1 (n-6 PUFA diets) or 2-3:1 (n-3 PUFA diets). We also examined whether changes in risk are associated with perturbations in biological processes previously linked to fatty acid intake and breast cancer. Mammary tumorigenesis was induced by treating 50-day-old rats with the carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene. When compared with the reference low-fat n-6 PUFA diet, prepubertal exposure to the low-fat n-3 PUFA diet decreased, whereas a high-fat n-3 PUFA diet increased mammary tumor incidence; the high-fat n-6 PUFA diet had no effect. Both the low and high-fat n-3 PUFA diets induced mammary epithelial differentiation by reducing the number of terminal end buds (TEBs) and increasing the presence of lobulo-alveolar structures. They also increased lipid peroxidation and reduced cyclooxygenase-2 activity. Prepubertal exposure to the low-fat n-3 PUFA diet increased apoptosis, determined using TUNEL assay, and reduced cell proliferation, determined using PCNA staining. In marked contrast, prepubertal exposure to the high-fat n-3 PUFA diet induced cell proliferation and inhibited apoptosis in the TEBs and lobular structures. The latter is consistent with the finding that pAkt, a survival factor that inhibits apoptosis, was elevated in their mammary glands. In summary, although prepubertal exposure to a low-fat n-3 PUFA diet reduced later mammary tumorigenesis in rats, high levels of this fatty acid can have adverse effects on the prepubertal mammary gland and increase subsequent breast cancer risk.},

	abstract = {For sixteen years, the American Institute of Nutrition Rodent Diets, AIN-76 and AIN-76A, have been used extensively around the world. Because of numerous nutritional and technical problems encountered with the diet during this period, it was revised. Two new formulations were derived: AIN-93G for growth, pregnancy and lactation, and AIN-93M for adult maintenance. Some major differences in the new formulation of AIN-93G compared with AIN-76A are as follows: 7 g soybean oil/100 g diet was substituted for 5 g corn oil/100 g diet to increase the amount of linolenic acid; cornstarch was substituted for sucrose; the amount of phosphorus was reduced to help eliminate the problem of kidney calcification in female rats; L-cystine was substituted for DL-methionine as the amino acid supplement for casein, known to be deficient in the sulfur amino acids; manganese concentration was lowered to one-fifth the amount in the old diet; the amounts of vitamin E, vitamin K and vitamin B-12 were increased; and molybdenum, silicon, fluoride, nickel, boron, lithium and vanadium were added to the mineral mix. For the AIN-93M maintenance diet, the amount of fat was lowered to 40 g/kg diet from 70 g/kg diet, and the amount of casein to 140 g/kg from 200 g/kg in the AIN-93G diet. Because of a better balance of essential nutrients, the AIN-93 diets may prove to be a better choice than AIN-76A for long-term as well as short-term studies with laboratory rodents.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Maternal infection during pregnancy increases risk of severe neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and autism, in the offspring. The most consistent brain structural abnormality in patients with schizophrenia is enlarged lateral ventricles. However, it is unknown whether the aetiology of ventriculomegaly in schizophrenia involves prenatal infectious processes. The present experiments tested the hypothesis that there is a causal relationship between prenatal immune challenge and emergence of ventricular abnormalities relevant to schizophrenia in adulthood. METHOD: We used an established mouse model of maternal immune activation (MIA) by the viral mimic PolyI:C administered in early (day 9) or late (day 17) gestation. Automated voxel-based morphometry mapped cerebrospinal fluid across the whole brain of adult offspring and the results were validated by manual region-of-interest tracing of the lateral ventricles. Parallel behavioral testing determined the existence of schizophrenia-related sensorimotor gating abnormalities. RESULTS: PolyI:C-induced immune activation, in early but not late gestation, caused marked enlargement of lateral ventricles in adulthood, without affecting total white and grey matter volumes. This early exposure disrupted sensorimotor gating, in the form of prepulse inhibition. Identical immune challenge in late gestation resulted in significant expansion of 4(th) ventricle volume but did not disrupt sensorimotor gating. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide the first experimental evidence that prenatal immune activation is an environmental risk factor for adult ventricular enlargement relevant to schizophrenia. The data indicate immune-associated environmental insults targeting early foetal development may have more extensive neurodevelopmental impact than identical insults in late prenatal life.},

	abstract = {By using differential display PCR, we have identified 98 cDNA fragments from the  rat dorsal hippocampus that are expressed differentially between the fast learners and slow learners in the water maze learning task. One of these cDNA fragments encodes the rat serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (sgk) gene. Northern blot analysis revealed that the sgk mRNA level was approximately 4-fold higher in the hippocampus of fast learners than slow learners. In situ hybridization results indicated that sgk mRNA level was increased markedly in CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus of hippocampus in fast learners. Transient transfection of the sgk mutant DNA to the CA1 area impaired, whereas transfection of the sgk wild-type DNA facilitated water maze performance in rats. These results provide direct evidence that enhanced sgk expression facilitates memory consolidation of spatial learning in rats. These results also elucidate the molecular mechanism of glucocorticoid-induced memory facilitation in mammals.},

	abstract = {We have previously demonstrated that the serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (sgk) gene plays a causal role in facilitating memory performance in rats. Environment enrichment is known to facilitate spatial learning. We therefore examined the effect of enrichment on sgk expression. We also examined the role of sgk in spatial and nonspatial learning and the regulation of sgk expression by activation of different glutamate receptors. Both real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses revealed that enrichment training preferentially increased sgk mRNA and protein levels in the hippocampus. Transfection of sgk mutant DNA to the hippocampal CA1 area markedly impaired spatial learning, fear-conditioning learning and novel object-recognition learning in rats, but enrichment training effectively reversed these learning deficits. Meanwhile, S422A mutant DNA transfection prevented enrichment-induced spatial learning facilitation. In studying glutamate receptor regulation of sgk expression, we found that blockade of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in general, and the NR2B subunit in particular both effectively blocked enrichment-induced spatial learning facilitation, but they did not block enrichment-induced sgk expression. Upon various glutamate agonist infusions, only alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) increased sgk mRNA levels significantly in the hippocampus. Furthermore, blockade of AMPA receptors effectively blocked both enrichment-induced spatial learning facilitation and sgk expression. These results indicate that there is a dissociation between NMDA receptor activation and sgk expression. Enrichment enhanced spatial learning through both NMDA and AMPA receptor activation, whereas enrichment-induced sgk expression is specifically mediated through AMPA receptors. These results suggest that sgk could serve as a novel molecular mechanism, in addition to the NMDA receptor NR2B, underlying enrichment-induced learning facilitation.},

	abstract = {The serum and glucocorticoid inducible kinase (SGK) 1 is expressed in brain tissue and upregulated by ischemia, neuronal excitation, and dehydration. The present study has been performed to elucidate the expression of SGK1 in cerebellar Purkinje cells and to explore whether it influences the colocalized glutamate transporter EAAT4. Intense SGK1 staining was observed in Purkinje cells following 48h of water deprivation. The kinase activates glutamate induced current (I(GLU)) in Xenopus oocytes heterologously expressing EAAT4, an effect mimicked by its isoforms SGK2, 3 and PKB. I(GLU) was decreased by the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2, an effect partially but not completely reversed by additional coexpression of the SGK kinase isoforms or PKB. According to immunohistochemistry EAAT4 protein abundance in the cell membrane was enhanced by SGK1 and decreased by Nedd4-2. In conclusion, SGK1 expression is upregulated by ischemia, excitation, and dehydration in cerebellar Purkinje cells. The upregulation of SGK1 may serve to stimulate EAAT4 and thus to reduce neuroexcitotoxicity.},

In addition, the paper reviews the findings suggesting that Ca(2+) is capable of inducing structural and cognitive deficits seen in schizophrenia. The evidence of the ability of antipsychotic drugs to affect Ca(2+) signaling is also presented. Based on these data, it is proposed that altered Ca(2+) signaling may constitute the central unifying molecular pathology in schizophrenia. According to this hypothesis schizophrenia can result from alterations in multiple proteins and other molecules as long as these alterations lead to abnormalities in certain key aspects of intracellular Ca(2+) signaling cascades.},

@article{Jiang2011a,
	abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) is a widely deployed transcriptome profiling and annotation technique, but questions about the performance of different protocols and platforms remain. We used a newly developed pool of 96 synthetic RNAs with various lengths, and GC content covering a 2(20) concentration range as spike-in controls to measure sensitivity, accuracy, and biases in RNA-seq experiments as well as to derive standard curves for quantifying the abundance of transcripts. We observed linearity between read density and RNA input over the entire detection range and excellent agreement between replicates, but we observed significantly larger imprecision than expected under pure Poisson sampling errors. We use the control RNAs to directly measure reproducible protocol-dependent biases due to GC content and transcript length as well as stereotypic heterogeneity in coverage across transcripts correlated with position relative to RNA termini and priming sequence bias. These effects lead to biased quantification for short transcripts and individual exons, which is a serious problem for measurements of isoform abundances, but that can partially be corrected using appropriate models of bias. By using the control RNAs, we derive limits for the discovery and detection of rare transcripts in RNA-seq experiments. By using data collected as part of the model organism and human Encyclopedia of DNA Elements projects (ENCODE and modENCODE), we demonstrate that external RNA controls are a useful resource for evaluating sensitivity and accuracy of RNA-seq experiments for transcriptome discovery and quantification. These quality metrics facilitate comparable analysis across different samples, protocols, and platforms. },

Epidemiological studies have indicated that the risk of developing these disorders is enhanced by prenatal maternal infection, presumably as a result of neurodevelopmental defects triggered by cytokine-related inflammatory events. Here, we demonstrate that the effects of maternal immune challenge between middle and late gestation periods in mice are dissociable in terms of fetal brain cytokine responses to maternal inflammation and the pathological consequences in brain and behavior. Specifically, the relative expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the fetal brains in response to maternal immune challenge may be an important determinant among other developmental factors for the precise pathological profile emerging in later life. Thus, the middle and late gestation periods correspond to two windows with differing vulnerability to adult behavioral dysfunction, brain neuropathology in early adolescence, and of the acute cytokine responses in the fetal brain.},

	abstract = {Docosahexenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) plays an important role in development of proper brain function in mammals. We have previously reported that DHA promotes synaptogenesis and synaptic function in hippocampal neurons while DHA-depletion in the brain due to n-3 fatty acid deficiency produces opposite effects. To gain insight into underlying molecular mechanisms, we investigated whether the brain DHA status affects the synaptic plasma membrane (SPM) proteome by using nanoLC/ESI-MS/MS and (16)O/(18)O labeling. The DHA level in mouse brains was lowered by dietary depletion of n-3 fatty acids, and SPM was prepared by differential centrifugation followed by osmotic shock. SPM proteins from DHA-adequate and depleted brains were analyzed by nanoLC/ESI-MS/MS after SDS-PAGE, in-gel digestion and differential O(18)/O(16) labeling. This strategy allowed comparative quantitation of more than 200 distinct membrane or membrane-associated proteins from DHA-adequate or depleted brains. We found that 18 pre- and postsynaptic proteins that are relevant to synaptic physiology were significantly down-regulated in DHA-depleted mouse brains. The protein network analysis suggests involvement of CREB and caspase-3 pathways in the DHA-dependent modulation of synaptic proteome. Reduction of specific synaptic proteins due to brain DHA-depletion may be an important mechanism for the suboptimal brain function associated with n-3 fatty acid deficiency. },

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) attenuate neonatal hypoxic/ischemic (H/I) brain damage, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. This study tested the hypothesis that n-3 PUFAs enhance Akt-dependent prosurvival signaling by promoting the biosynthesis of phosphatidylserine in neuronal cell membranes. METHODS: Dietary n-3 PUFA supplementation was initiated on the second day of pregnancy in dams. H/I was induced in 7-day-old rat pups by ipsilateral common carotid artery occlusion followed by hypoxia (8{\%} oxygen for 2.5 hours). Neurological outcomes, brain tissue loss, cell death, and the activation of signaling events were assessed after H/I. The effects of n-3 PUFAs (docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid) on oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced cell death and the underlying mechanism of protection were also examined in primary cortical neuron cultures. RESULTS: n-3 PUFAs reduced brain tissue loss at 7 days after H/I and improved neurological outcomes, whereas inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling by LY294002 partially abrogated this neuroprotective effect. Docosahexaenoic acid/eicosapentaenoic acid also prevented ischemic neuronal death through the Akt prosurvival pathway in vitro. Furthermore, docosahexaenoic acid/eicosapentaenoic acid increased the production of phosphatidylserine, the major membrane-bound phospholipids, after ischemia both in vitro and in vivo. A reduction in membrane phosphatidylserine by shRNA-mediated knockdown of phosphatidylserine synthetase-1 attenuated Akt activation and neuronal survival after docosahexaenoic acid/eicosapentaenoic acid treatment in the oxygen-glucose deprivation model. CONCLUSIONS: n-3 PUFAs robustly protect against H/I-induced brain damage in neonates by activating Akt prosurvival pathway in compromised neurons. In addition, n-3 PUFAs promote the formation of membrane phosphatidylserine, thereby promoting Akt activity and improving cellular survival.},

Although technological advances have provided us with relatively easy and cheap methods for genotyping, promises about personalised medicine have not yet met our high expectations. Successful results that have been achieved within the field of pharmacogenomics so far are, to name a few, HLA-B*5701 screening to avoid hypersensitivity to the antiretroviral abacavir, thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) genotyping to avoid thiopurine toxicity, and CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotyping for better dosing of the anticoagulant warfarin. However, few pharmacogenetic examples have made it into clinical practice in the treatment of complex diseases. Unfortunately, lack of reproducibility of results from observational studies involving many genes and diseases seems to be a common pattern in pharmacogenomic studies. In this article we address some of the methodological and statistical issues within study design, gene and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) selection and data analysis that should be considered in future pharmacogenomic research. First, we discuss some of the issues related to the design of epidemiological studies, specific to pharmacogenomic research. Second, we describe some of the pros and cons of a candidate gene approach (including gene and SNP selection) and a genome-wide scan approach. Finally, conventional as well as several innovative approaches to the analysis of large pharmacogenomic datasets are proposed that deal with the issues of multiple testing and systems biology in different ways.},

	abstract = {Epidemiological data indicate that low n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PFA) intake is a readily manipulated dietary risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies in animals confirm the deleterious effect of n-3 PFA depletion on cognition and on dendritic scaffold proteins. Here, we show that in transgenic mice overexpressing the human AD gene APPswe (Tg2576), safflower oil-induced n-3 PFA deficiency caused a decrease in N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits, NR2A and NR2B, in the cortex and hippocampus with no loss of the presynaptic markers, synaptophysin and synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25). n-3 PFA depletion also decreased the NR1 subunit in the hippocampus and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) in the cortex of Tg2576 mice. These effects of dietary n-3 PFA deficiency were greatly amplified in Tg2576 mice compared to nontransgenic mice. Loss of the NR2B receptor subunit was not explained by changes in mRNA expression, but correlated with p85alpha phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase levels. Most interestingly, n-3 PFA deficiency dramatically increased levels of protein fragments, corresponding to caspase/calpain-cleaved fodrin and gelsolin in Tg2576 mice. This effect was minimal in nontransgenic mice suggesting that n-3 PFA depletion potentiated caspase activation in the Tg2576 mouse model of AD. Dietary supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22 : 6n-3) partly protected from NMDA receptor subunit loss and accumulation of fodrin and gelsolin fragments but fully prevented CaMKII decrease. The marked effect of dietary n-3 PFA on NMDA receptors and caspase/calpain activation in the cortex of an animal model of AD provide new insights into how dietary essential fatty acids may influence cognition and AD risk.},

	abstract = {Recent molecular genetics studies implicate neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and its receptor erbB in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Among NRG1 receptors, erbB4 is of particular interest because of its crucial roles in neurodevelopment and in the modulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor signaling. Here, using a new postmortem tissue-stimulation approach, we show a marked increase in NRG1-induced activation of erbB4 in the prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia. Levels of NRG1 and erbB4, however, did not differ between schizophrenia and control groups. To evaluate possible causes for this hyperactivation of erbB4 signaling, we examined the association of erbB4 with PSD-95 (postsynaptic density protein of 95 kDa), as this association has been shown to facilitate activation of erbB4. Schizophrenia subjects showed substantial increases in erbB4-PSD-95 interactions. We found that NRG1 stimulation suppresses NMDA receptor activation in the human prefrontal cortex, as previously reported in the rodent cortex. NRG1-induced suppression of NMDA receptor activation was more pronounced in schizophrenia subjects than in controls, consistent with enhanced NRG1-erbB4 signaling seen in this illness. Therefore, these findings suggest that enhanced NRG1 signaling may contribute to NMDA hypofunction in schizophrenia.},

An expanding set of receptors and cellular stress pathways has been shown to enhance sgk1 expression, which is implicated in the regulation of ion channel conductance, cell volume, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. Recent evidence for the involvement of sgk1 in the early pathogenesis of MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease (PD) prompted us to investigate in more detail its expression and role in animal models of different neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we show that transcription of sgk1 is increased in several animal models of PD and a transgenic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The upregulation of sgk1 strongly correlates with the occurrence of cell death. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the Forkhead transcription factor FKHRL1 and some of the voltage-gated potassium channels are physiological substrates of sgk1 in vivo. Using a small interfering RNA approach to silence sgk1 transcripts in vitro, we give evidence that sgk1 exerts a protective role in oxidative stress situations. These findings underline a key role for sgk1 in the molecular pathway of cell death, in which sgk1 seems to exert a protective role.},

	abstract = {A small number of rare, recurrent genomic copy number variants (CNVs) are known to substantially increase susceptibility to schizophrenia. As a consequence of the low fecundity in people with schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental phenotypes to which these CNVs contribute, CNVs with large effects on risk are likely to be rapidly removed from the population by natural selection. Accordingly, such CNVs must frequently occur as recurrent de novo mutations. In a sample of 662 schizophrenia proband-parent trios, we found that rare de novo CNV mutations were significantly more frequent in cases (5.1{\%} all cases, 5.5{\%} family history negative) compared with 2.2{\%} among 2623 controls, confirming the involvement of de novo CNVs in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Eight de novo CNVs occurred at four known schizophrenia loci (3q29, 15q11.2, 15q13.3 and 16p11.2). De novo CNVs of known pathogenic significance in other genomic disorders were also observed, including deletion at the TAR (thrombocytopenia absent radius) region on 1q21.1 and duplication at the WBS (Williams-Beuren syndrome) region at 7q11.23. Multiple de novos spanned genes encoding members of the DLG (discs large) family of membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs) that are components of the postsynaptic density (PSD). Two de novos also affected EHMT1, a histone methyl transferase known to directly regulate DLG family members. Using a systems biology approach and merging novel CNV and proteomics data sets, systematic analysis of synaptic protein complexes showed that, compared with control CNVs, case de novos were significantly enriched for the PSD proteome (P=1.72 x 10(-)(6). This was largely explained by enrichment for members of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) (P=4.24 x 10(-)(6)) and neuronal activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (ARC) (P=3.78 x 10(-)(8)) postsynaptic signalling complexes. In an analysis of 18 492 subjects (7907 cases and 10 585 controls), case CNVs were enriched for members of the NMDAR complex (P=0.0015) but not ARC (P=0.14). Our data indicate that defects in NMDAR postsynaptic signalling and, possibly, ARC complexes, which are known to be important in synaptic plasticity and cognition, play a significant role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.},

We developed an analysis framework to rank pathways that requires only summary statistics. We combined this score across disorders to find common pathways across three adult psychiatric disorders: schizophrenia, major depression and bipolar disorder. Histone methylation processes showed the strongest association, and we also found statistically significant evidence for associations with multiple immune and neuronal signaling pathways and with the postsynaptic density. Our study indicates that risk variants for psychiatric disorders aggregate in particular biological pathways and that these pathways are frequently shared between disorders.

We introduce a second generation splice detection algorithm, MapSplice, whose focus is high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of splices as well as CPU and memory efficiency. MapSplice can be applied to both short (<75 bp) and long reads (>/= 75 bp). MapSplice is not dependent on splice site features or intron length, consequently it can detect novel canonical as well as non-canonical splices. MapSplice leverages the quality and diversity of read alignments of a given splice to increase accuracy. We demonstrate that MapSplice achieves higher sensitivity and specificity than TopHat and SpliceMap on a set of simulated RNA-seq data. Experimental studies also support the accuracy of the algorithm. Splice junctions derived from eight breast cancer RNA-seq datasets recapitulated the extensiveness of alternative splicing on a global level as well as the differences between molecular subtypes of breast cancer. These combined results indicate that MapSplice is a highly accurate algorithm for the alignment of RNA-seq reads to splice junctions.

Here, we describe an application of the Illumina sequencing (formerly Solexa sequencing) platform to study mRNA expression levels. Our goals were to estimate technical variance associated with Illumina sequencing in this context and to compare its ability to identify differentially expressed genes with existing array technologies. To do so, we estimated gene expression differences between liver and kidney RNA samples using multiple sequencing replicates, and compared the sequencing data to results obtained from Affymetrix arrays using the same RNA samples. We find that the Illumina sequencing data are highly replicable, with relatively little technical variation, and thus, for many purposes, it may suffice to sequence each mRNA sample only once (i.e., using one lane). The information in a single lane of Illumina sequencing data appears comparable to that in a single array in enabling identification of differentially expressed genes, while allowing for additional analyses such as detection of low-expressed genes, alternative splice variants, and novel transcripts. Based on our observations, we propose an empirical protocol and a statistical framework for the analysis of gene expression using ultra-high-throughput sequencing technology.},

	abstract = {RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) has rapidly become a popular tool to characterize transcriptomes. A fundamental research problem in many RNA-seq studies is the identification of reliable molecular markers that show differential expression between distinct sample groups. Together with the growing popularity of RNA-seq, a number of data analysis methods and pipelines have already been developed for this task. Currently, however, there is no clear consensus about the best practices yet, which makes the choice of an appropriate method a daunting task especially for a basic user without a strong statistical or computational background. To assist the choice, we perform here a systematic comparison of eight widely used software packages and pipelines for detecting differential expression between sample groups in a practical research setting and provide general guidelines for choosing a robust pipeline. In general, our results demonstrate how the data analysis tool utilized can markedly affect the outcome of the data analysis, highlighting the importance of this choice.},

A critical step in RNA-seq data analysis is the alignment of partial transcript reads to a reference genome sequence. To assess the performance of current mapping software, we invited developers of RNA-seq aligners to process four large human and mouse RNA-seq data sets. In total, we compared 26 mapping protocols based on 11 programs and pipelines and found major performance differences between methods on numerous benchmarks, including alignment yield, basewise accuracy, mismatch and gap placement, exon junction discovery and suitability of alignments for transcript reconstruction. We observed concordant results on real and simulated RNA-seq data, confirming the relevance of the metrics employed. Future developments in RNA-seq alignment methods would benefit from improved placement of multimapped reads, balanced utilization of existing gene annotation and a reduced false discovery rate for splice junctions.},

The signalling mechanisms that regulate neuronal excitability are particularly important for processes such as sensory perception, cognition and consciousness. The Ca(2+) signalling pathway is a key component of the mechanisms responsible for regulating neuronal excitability, information processing and cognition. Alterations in gene transcription are particularly important as they result in subtle alterations in the neuronal signalling mechanisms that have been implicated in many neural diseases. In particular, dysregulation of the Ca(2+) signalling pathway has been implicated in the development of some of the major psychiatric diseases such as bipolar disorder (BPD) and schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders have been shown to have deficits in sensorimotor gating as assessed by prepulse inhibition of the startle response. The authors hypothesized that nonschizophrenic relatives of patients with schizophrenia would also have prepulse inhibition deficits, thereby reflecting a genetically transmitted susceptibility to sensorimotor gating deficits. METHOD: Twenty-five comparison subjects, 23 patients with schizophrenia, 34 relatives of the schizophrenic patients, and 11 subjects with schizotypal personality disorder were assessed in an acoustic startle paradigm. The eye-blink component of the startle response was assessed bilaterally by using electromyographic recordings of orbicularis oculi. RESULTS: The patients with schizophrenia, their relatives, and subjects with schizotypal personality disorder all had reduced prepulse inhibition relative to comparison subjects, and these deficits were more evident in measures of right eye-blink prepulse inhibition. Comparison subjects demonstrated greater right versus left eye-blink prepulse inhibition, whereas the probands, their relatives, and subjects with schizotypal personality disorder showed less asymmetry of prepulse inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a genetically transmitted deficit in prepulse inhibition (sensorimotor gating) in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, including subjects with schizotypal personality disorder and relatives of patients with schizophrenia.},

@article{Clarke2009,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to determine whether prenatal exposure to infection and a positive family history of psychotic disorders interact synergistically to increase the risk of later developing schizophrenia. METHOD: The authors linked two national registers, the Medical Birth Register and the Finnish Population Register, to identify all women in Helsinki who received hospital treatment during pregnancy for an upper urinary tract infection (N=9,596) between 1947 and 1990. The Finnish Hospital Discharge Register was used to ascertain psychiatric outcomes in adulthood of offspring exposed to infection prenatally. Family history of psychotic disorders was determined by linking the Hospital Discharge Register and the Population Register. The authors used an additive statistical interaction model to calculate the amount of biological synergism between positive family history and prenatal exposure to infection. RESULTS: Prenatal exposure to infection did not significantly increase the risk of schizophrenia. However, the effect of prenatal exposure to pyelonephritis was five times greater in those who had a family history of psychosis compared to those who did not. The synergy analysis suggested that an estimated 38{\%}-46{\%} of the offspring who developed schizophrenia and had both prenatal exposure to infection and a positive family history of psychotic disorders did so as a result of the synergistic action of both risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support a mechanism of gene-environment interaction in the causation of schizophrenia.},

To enable this analysis, we introduce a new method, stratified LD score regression, for partitioning heritability from GWAS summary statistics while accounting for linked markers. This new method is computationally tractable at very large sample sizes and leverages genome-wide information. Our findings include a large enrichment of heritability in conserved regions across many traits, a very large immunological disease-specific enrichment of heritability in FANTOM5 enhancers and many cell type-specific enrichments, including significant enrichment of central nervous system cell types in the heritability of body mass index, age at menarche, educational attainment and smoking behavior.},

@article{Sogaard2013,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A number of studies have shown poorer survival among cancer patients with comorbidity. Several mechanisms may underlie this finding. In this review we summarize the current literature on the association between patient comorbidity and cancer prognosis. Prognostic factors examined include tumor biology, diagnosis, treatment, clinical quality, and adherence. METHODS: All English-language articles published during 2002–2012 on the association between comorbidity and survival among patients with colon cancer, breast cancer, and lung cancer were identified from PubMed, MEDLINE and Embase. Titles and abstracts were reviewed to identify eligible studies and their main results were then extracted. RESULTS: Our search yielded more than 2,500 articles related to comorbidity and cancer, but few investigated the prognostic impact of comorbidity as a primary aim. Most studies found that cancer patients with comorbidity had poorer survival than those without comorbidity, with 5-year mortality hazard ratios ranging from 1.1 to 5.8. Few studies examined the influence of specific chronic conditions. In general, comorbidity does not appear to be associated with more aggressive types of cancer or other differences in tumor biology. Presence of specific severe comorbidities or psychiatric disorders were found to be associated with delayed cancer diagnosis in some studies, while chronic diseases requiring regular medical visits were associated with earlier cancer detection in others. Another finding was that patients with comorbidity do not receive standard cancer treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy as often as patients without comorbidity, and their chance of completing a course of cancer treatment is lower. Postoperative complications and mortality are higher in patients with comorbidity. It is unclear from the literature whether the apparent undertreatment reflects appropriate consideration of greater toxicity risk, poorer clinical quality, patient preferences, or poor adherence among patients with comorbidity. CONCLUSION: Despite increasing recognition of the importance of comorbid illnesses among cancer patients, major challenges remain. Both treatment effectiveness and compliance appear compromised among cancer patients with comorbidity. Data on clinical quality is limited. },

Anxiety and depressive symptoms are also very common throughout the course of illness, with an estimated prevalence of 15\% for panic disorder, 29\% for posttraumatic stress disorder, and 23\% for obsessive-compulsive disorder. It is estimated that comorbid depression occurs in 50\% of patients, and perhaps (conservatively) 47\% of patients also have a lifetime diagnosis of comorbid substance abuse. This article chronicles these associations, examining whether these comorbidities are “more than chance” and might represent (distinct) phenotypes of schizophrenia.

@article{Alvir1993,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent that is more effective than standard neuroleptic drugs in the treatment of patients with refractory schizophrenia. Unlike classic neuroleptic agents, clozapine is not associated with the development of acute extrapyramidal symptoms or tardive dyskinesia. The main factor limiting its use is the risk of potentially fatal agranulocytosis, estimated to occur in 1 to 2 percent of treated patients. After clozapine was approved by the Food and Drug Administration, it became available for marketing in the United States in February 1990 only as part of a special surveillance system (the Clozaril Patient Management System, or CPMS), in which a weekly white-cell count was required for the patient to receive a supply of the drug. METHODS: We evaluated the CPMS data for February 1990 through April 1991 by survival analysis to determine the incidence of agranulocytosis and the effects of potential risk factors such as age and sex. Data were available for 11,555 patients who received clozapine during the period after marketing began. RESULTS: Agranulocytosis developed in 73 patients, resulting in death from infectious complications in 2 patients. Episodes of agranulocytosis occurred in 61 patients within three months after they began treatment. The cumulative incidence of this side effect was 0.80 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.61 to 0.99) at 1 year and 0.91 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.62 to 1.20) at 1 1/2 years. The risk of agranulocytosis increased with age and was higher among women. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of agranulocytosis is a substantial hazard of the administration of clozapine, but this hazard can be reduced by monitoring the white-cell count. The increasing risk of agranulocytosis with age and the reduced incidence after the first six months of treatment provide additional guidelines for the prescription and monitoring of clozapine treatment in the future.},

	abstract = {Clozapine represented the first significant advance in the pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia since the introduction of conventional antipsychotic drugs in the 1950's. Despite its superior efficacy and potential to reduce substantially the morbidity of schizophrenia and improve the outcomes, of patients, clozapine has not been used on a widespread basis or as a first-line treatment due to its potential for agranulocytosis. With the introduction of risperidone and the imminent prospect of other atypical antipsychotic drugs (olanzapine, sertindole, quetiapine, ziprasidone), clinicians may be able to improve dramatically the methods and manner in which they treat schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders. If we accept the premise that atypical antipsychotic drug provide superior efficacy, reduced side effects, and the prospect of better compliance, their greatest impact may be when used in patients at the beginning of their illness. The following article provides a rationale and hypothesis for the use of atypical antipsychotic drugs as a first-line treatment of schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {It is no longer tenable to attribute all the antipsychotic action of antipsychotic drugs to dopamine (DA) D2 receptor blockade and subsequent development of depolarization inactivation of the mesolimbic or mesocortical DA neurons. The chief evidence for this position is that clozapine (CLOZ) does not differ from typical antipsychotic drugs in these regards but is more effective than typical neuroleptic drugs. The mechanism of action of atypical antipsychotic drugs related to CLOZ may involve reduction of dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic system by a variety of mechanisms, including D1 and D2 receptor blockade. Relatively higher affinity for the serotonin (5HT)2 receptor than for the D2 receptor may also be important to the action of CLOZ-like compounds. Enhanced DA release in the mesocortical system may be relevant to the effectiveness of these agents in treating negative symptoms. Several other classes of new agents alter the dopaminergic system by means of alternative mechanisms. Partial DA agonists may modulate DA neurotransmission more adequately than pure antagonists by producing a mix of direct agonist and antagonistic effects. DA autoreceptor agonists and 5HT3 antagonists appear to act by diminishing the release of DA from some, but not all, DA neurons. Substituted benzamides are “pure” D2 antagonists with some in vivo selectivity for limbic D2 over striatal D2 receptors. Highly selective D1 antagonists have been proposed to produce equivalent antipsychotic activity and fewer extrapyramidal symptoms than D2 antagonists. Antagonists of the recently identified D3 receptors are being sought. Excessive stimulation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of the glutamate receptor, leading to neurotoxicity or diminished activation of this receptor, is the target of novel approaches to treating schizophrenia. Phencyclidine (PCP) antagonists that would activate the NMDA receptor and sigma receptor antagonists are of interest as antipsychotic agents. Therapeutic strategies for treating schizophrenia, schizophrenia-related disorders, and other psychoses will likely be genuinely diverse in the next decade.},

	abstract = {The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia has been one of the most enduring ideas in psychiatry. Initially, the emphasis was on a role of hyperdopaminergia in the etiology of schizophrenia (version I), but it was subsequently reconceptualized to specify subcortical hyperdopaminergia with prefrontal hypodopaminergia (version II). However, these hypotheses focused too narrowly on dopamine itself, conflated psychosis and schizophrenia, and predated advances in the genetics, molecular biology, and imaging research in schizophrenia. Since version II, there have been over 6700 articles about dopamine and schizophrenia. We selectively review these data to provide an overview of the 5 critical streams of new evidence: neurochemical imaging studies, genetic evidence, findings on environmental risk factors, research into the extended phenotype, and animal studies. We synthesize this evidence into a new dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia-version III: the final common pathway. This hypothesis seeks to be comprehensive in providing a framework that links risk factors, including pregnancy and obstetric complications, stress and trauma, drug use, and genes, to increased presynaptic striatal dopaminergic function. It explains how a complex array of pathological, positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and other findings, such as frontotemporal structural and functional abnormalities and cognitive impairments, may converge neurochemically to cause psychosis through aberrant salience and lead to a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The hypothesis has one major implication for treatment approaches. Current treatments are acting downstream of the critical neurotransmitter abnormality. Future drug development and research into etiopathogenesis should focus on identifying and manipulating the upstream factors that converge on the dopaminergic funnel point.},

Rats were chronically administered saline, clozapine, haloperidol, or haloperidol plus the anticholinergic compound trihexyphenidyl, and threshold sensitivity of the mesolimbic and nigrostriatal DA systems was assessed using the BSR paradigm, to infer degree of functional DA blockade produced by the chronic drug regimens. Chronic saline produced no change in either DA system. Congruent with previous findings, chronic clozapine powerfully inhibited the mesolimbic DA system but spared the nigrostriatal DA system. Also congruent with previous findings, chronic haloperidol powerfully inhibited both DA systems. Compared to chronic haloperidol alone, chronic haloperidol plus chronic trihexyphenidyl exerted diminished anti-DA action in both the mesolimbic and nigrostriatal DA systems. These results suggest that clozapine's anticholinergic potency is not an adequate explanation for its functional mesolimbic selectivity.},

The atypical drugs differ from the typicals in their mechanism of action, but not all share the same mechanism. Many, but not all, atypicals have been found to improve cognitive function, which could be their most important advantage with regard to efficacy. Clozapine, the prototype of these agents, has been found to improve delusions and hallucinations in patients who fail to respond to other antipsychotic drugs, and to reduce the risk of suicide. These agents have been found to increase cortical dopamine and acetylcholine release, as well as have a variety of effects on the glutamatergic system not shared by the typical agents. Effects on neuronal survival and plasticity, together with decreased neurotoxicity, might also contribute to their clinical advantage over typical neuroleptic drugs.},

	abstract = {Antipsychotic treatment response is highly heterogeneous and unpredictable in terms of both efficacy and side effects. A combination of factors influences treatment outcome, including clinical, demographic, environmental and genetic factors. No comprehensive studies have quantified the relative contributions of these factors to date. Two decades of pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic studies have attempted to identify key gene variants associated with antipsychotic response, with a dual goal of better understanding the mechanisms underlying drug response and guiding prescribing decisions in clinical care. Pharmacogenetic studies have succeeded in identifying several genes that are associated with antipsychotic treatment efficacy or side effects. However, the strength of these associations is modest and they are of limited clinical value. Genome-wide association studies, moving beyond hypothesis-based discovery, have greater potential to identify novel gene associations, although only a few genome-wide association studies have been conducted and they have not revealed clearly significant findings. The first pharmacogenetic tests to guide the selection or dosing of antipsychotic drugs are now commercially available. Their uptake has been limited by the modest level of prediction they offer, compounded by the lack of data supporting their clinical or economic benefits. Advances in genomic analysis techniques, the better characterization of larger subject cohorts and an improved understanding of the role of environmental factors and gene?environment interactions are renewing hope that future research will identify genetic variants with stronger associations with treatment outcome. Tests incorporating such genetic data, with environmental and clinical variables, may offer the potential to personalize medicine and significantly improve the efficacy and tolerability of antipsychotic treatment.},

We report on the development and initial standardization of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) for typological and dimensional assessment. Based on two established psychiatric rating systems, the 30-item PANSS was conceived as an operationalized, drug-sensitive instrument that provides balanced representation of positive and negative symptoms and gauges their relationship to one another and to global psychopathology. It thus constitutes four scales measuring positive and negative syndromes, their differential, and general severity of illness. Study of 101 schizophrenics found the four scales to be normally distributed and supported their reliability and stability. Positive and negative scores were inversely correlated once their common association with general psychopathology was extracted, suggesting that they represent mutually exclusive constructs. Review of five studies involving the PANSS provided evidence of its criterion-related validity with antecedent, genealogical, and concurrent measures, its predictive validity, its drug sensitivity, and its utility for both typological and dimensional assessment. },

We examine in detail one natural application of the model: estimation of underlying recombination rates from population data. Using simulation, we show that in the case where recombination is assumed constant across the region of interest, recombination rate estimates based on our model are competitive with the very best of current available methods. More importantly, we demonstrate, on real and simulated data, the potential of the model to help identify and quantify fine-scale variation in recombination rate from population data. We also outline how the model could be useful in other contexts, such as in the development of more efficient haplotype-based methods for LD mapping.},
