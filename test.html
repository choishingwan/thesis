Another alignment method is to align the reads directly to the genome. However, as reads are originated from the mRNA transcripts, the intronic regions might be spliced out. Therefore, the alignment algorithm will have to “split” the reads in order to align them onto the corresponding exons. Some of the splice aware aligner includes TopHat2 (D. Kim et al., 2013), STAR (Dobin et al., 2013) and MapSplice (K. Wang et al., 2010).
